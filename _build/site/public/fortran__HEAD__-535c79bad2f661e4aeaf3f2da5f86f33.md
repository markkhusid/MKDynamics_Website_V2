# Fortran Programming

![fortran_code](images/fortran_code.jpeg)

## Introduction
In this section, we will discuss and experiment with Fortran programming. Fortran is a high-level programming language that is used for numerical and scientific computing. It is a general-purpose, compiled language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Fortran was originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications. It has since been updated and improved, and is still widely used in scientific computing and high-performance computing.

Worked examples and exercises will be provided from the following textbooks and resources: <br>
