## Portfolio Project Report: Summary

### CSE548: Advanced Computer Network Security

This summary presents the outcomes of four projects conducted within the scope of the CSE548 Advanced Network Security course, which emphasize the integration of network security principles with practical implementations and machine learning techniques. There were four individual projects in this course.

#### Project 1: Packet Filter Firewall: Implementation of an Iptables-Based Packet Filter Firewall

Project 1 is titled: Packet Filter Firewall: Implementation of an Iptables-Based Packet Filter Firewall.  The project involved setting up a firewall with rules ensuring controlled access and restricted communication between nodes in a simulated network.  To meet the requirements of this project, we set up an iptables firewall and a web server on a Gateway / Server virtual machine.  The iptables firewall was used to restrict network and internet access of the client as well as the  Gateway / Server as per the project requirements.  Verification of the Gateway / Server was performed and found to be in compliance.

#### Project 2: SDN-Based Stateless Firewall: Implementation of an SDN-Based Stateless Firewall

Project 2 is titled: SDN – Based Stateless Firewall.  The firewall resided on an Open Virtual Switch that implements the OpenFlow protocol.  A POX instance acts as the controller for the Open Virtual Switch.  Containers are instantiated using Mininet to create four containers.  Layer 2 and Layer 3 firewall rules are applied to the controller using a firewall application running the on application plane.  Various tests are performed in order to test the functionality of the firewall application.

#### Project 3: SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project

Project 3  is titled: SDN – Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project.  The purpose of this project is to learn about Software Defined Networking and implementing Denial of Service (DoS) attack mitigation.  In this project an Open Virtual Switch is created that operates on the OpenFlow protocol.  A POX instance acts as the controller for the Open Virtual Switch.  Containers are instantiated using Mininet to create four containers.  The L3 firewall application was modified to detect DoS attacks and permanently block the offending MAC address.  Various tests are performed in order to test the functionality of the firewall application.

#### Project 4: Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection

Project 4 is titled: Machine Learning – Based Anomaly Detection.  The purpose of this Project is to use machine learning to spot abnormal patterns in network traffic and identify potential attacks from hackers.  Training data for the machine learning models is provided by the Course Team.  Two distinct models are trained and tested against three different test sets.  Testing / validation accuracy and loss are determined, as well as construction of a confusion matrix for the three separate testing conditions.  An assessment is made to determine the model with the most testing accuracy, and then to figure out why that model fares better than others.  This determination involves examining the training data and testing data to notice any particular patterns in the categories and subcategories of attacks.
