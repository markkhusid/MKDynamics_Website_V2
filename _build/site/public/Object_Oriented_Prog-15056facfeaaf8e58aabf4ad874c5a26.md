# Chapter 3: Functions and Pointers

## Introduction

In this section we will be following along with the examples from "Object Oriented Programming Using C++" by Ira Pohl (Addison Wesley). We will use Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Book to facilitate rapid production of HTML content. Where appropriate, the output of the C++ code will be displayed in graphical format using Python scripts and Matplotlib.
