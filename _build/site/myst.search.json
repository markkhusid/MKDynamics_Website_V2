This allows the function to modify the value of the integer that the pointer points to.\n\nPointer Dereferencing: Inside the increment function, the value pointed to by p is incremented by 1 using the dereference operator *.\n\nPointer Initialization: In the main function, an integer i is declared and initialized to 10. A pointer j is then initialized to point to i using the address-of operator &.\n\nFunction Call: The increment function is called with j as the argument. Since j points to i, the value of i is incremented.\n\nOutput: The program prints the value of i before and after the function call, demonstrating that the value of i has been modified through the pointer.\n\nPointer vs. Value: The program illustrates the difference between passing a pointer (which allows modification of the original variable) and passing a value (which would not allow modification).\n\nMemory Address: The address of i is passed to the function, allowing the function to directly modify the value stored at that memory address.\n\nOutput: The output of the program will show that the value of i has been incremented from 10 to 11 after the function call.\n\nPointer Type: The pointer type int * indicates that the pointer is pointing to an integer value. This is important for type safety and ensures that the correct amount of memory is accessed.\n\nFunction Signature: The function signature void increment(int *p) indicates that the function does not return a value (void) and takes a single argument of type int * (pointer to int).\n\nFunction Body: The function body contains the logic to increment the value pointed to by p. The dereference operator * is used to access the value at the memory address stored in p.\n\nMain Function: The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes variables, calls the increment function, and prints the results.\n\nVariable Scope: The variable i is declared in the main function, and its scope is limited to that function. However, the pointer j can be passed to other functions, allowing those functions to modify the value of i.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-5-4-passing-pointers-as-arguments#explanation-of-the-above-code","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 5.4 Passing Pointers as Arguments","lvl2":"Compile and Run Code"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-5-4-passing-pointers-as-arguments#compile-and-run-code","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 5.4 Passing Pointers as Arguments","lvl2":"Compile and Run Code"},"content":"\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-5-4-passing-pointers-as-arguments#compile-and-run-code","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 5.4 Passing Pointers as Arguments","lvl3":"Use Python to Change to Working Directory","lvl2":"Compile and Run Code"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-5-4-passing-pointers-as-arguments#use-python-to-change-to-working-directory","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 5.4 Passing Pointers as Arguments","lvl3":"Use Python to Change to Working Directory","lvl2":"Compile and Run Code"},"content":"\n\nimport os\nroot_dir = os.getcwd()\n\n\n\ncode_dir = root_dir + \"/\" + \"C_Code\"\n\n\n\nos.chdir(code_dir)\n\n\n\nbuild_command = os.system(\"gcc -o section_5_4_passing_pointers_as_arguments section_5_4_passing_pointers_as_arguments.c\")\n\n\n\nexec_status = os.system(\"./section_5_4_passing_pointers_as_arguments\")\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-5-4-passing-pointers-as-arguments#use-python-to-change-to-working-directory","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 6.1 Arrays: An Easy Example"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-6-1-arrays-an-easy-example","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 6.1 Arrays: An Easy Example"},"content":"Adapted from: “Beej’s Guide to C Programming” by Brian (Beej Jorgensen) Hall: \n\nBeej’s Guide to C Programming: 6.1 An Easy Example\n\nBrian (Beej Jorgensen) Hall Website\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-6-1-arrays-an-easy-example","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 6.1 Arrays: An Easy Example","lvl2":"Program for Creating, Initializing, and Printing an Array"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-6-1-arrays-an-easy-example#program-for-creating-initializing-and-printing-an-array","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 6.1 Arrays: An Easy Example","lvl2":"Program for Creating, Initializing, and Printing an Array"},"content":"\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    int i;\n    float f[4];  // Declare an array of 4 floats\n\n    f[0] = 3.14159;  // Indexing starts at 0, of course.\n    f[1] = 1.41421;\n    f[2] = 1.61803;\n    f[3] = 2.71828;\n\n    // Print them all out:\n\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        printf(\"%f\\n\", f[i]);\n    }\n}\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-6-1-arrays-an-easy-example#program-for-creating-initializing-and-printing-an-array","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 6.1 Arrays: An Easy Example","lvl2":"Explanation of the Above Code"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/section-6-1-arrays-an-easy-example#explanation-of-the-above-code","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 6.1 Arrays: An Easy Example","lvl2":"Explanation of the Above Code"},"content":"\n\nInclude the Standard I/O Library: The program starts by including the standard input/output library with #include <stdio.h>, which allows us to use functions like printf().\n\nMain Function: The main() function is the entry point of the program.\n\nVariable Declaration: Inside the main() function, we declare an integer variable i and a float array f with 4 elements.\n\nArray Initialization: We assign values to each element of the array f using indexing.

The DFT is a powerful tool in signal processing and is used in a wide range of applications, including audio and image processing, communications, and control systems.\n\nThe Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the DFT of a signal more efficiently than the standard DFT algorithm. The FFT algorithm exploits the symmetry properties of the DFT to reduce the number of computations required to compute the DFT. The FFT algorithm is widely used in practice due to its speed and efficiency.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use the FFTW3 library to compute the DFT of an arbitrary signal.

DFFT from Processed Data File\n! Written by Mark Khusid 2015\n!\n! 2018\n! Version 6\n! Increased amount of command line arguments to 5 from 3.  The added two were sample rate and number of periods.\n! Cleaned up indentation and formatting.\n! Modified the write_DFFT_to_file subroutine to output not only the DFFT data element but also the corrected frequency\n! on each line of the data file.  The DFFT data element and corrected frequency are separated by a space\n! Obtained the corrected frequency based on the sampe rate and the next power of two of the total number of samples (i.e. 100 samples -> next power of 2 = 128.)\n! Since there are num_bins_int number of data elements in FFT array, and the FFT array is symmetric, we divide the magnitude by half the num_bins_int to get the normalized magnitude.\n!\n! Version 5\n! Commented out debug code and rearranged some inconsequential lines.\n!\n! 2015\n! Version 4\n! Numerous fixes.  Changed code to allocate memory based on the next power of 2 relative\n! to the number of element in the input file.  For example, a data file with 1000 data elements\n! will cause arrays to be allocated with 1024 elements.  This is done to prevent errors in the FFT.\n! Extra array space above and beyond what is in data file is padded with zeros.\n! Reformatted most of the debug output.\n! Used ATAN2, separate variables and formatting to ensure that small values of the real part will not \n! cause phase errors.\n!\n! Version 3\n! This version counts the number of data elements in the file automatically.\n!

DFFT from Processed Data File\n! Written by Mark Khusid 2015\n!\n! 2018\n! Version 6\n! Increased amount of command line arguments to 5 from 3.  The added two were sample rate and number of periods.\n! Cleaned up indentation and formatting.\n! Modified the write_DFFT_to_file subroutine to output not only the DFFT data element but also the corrected frequency\n! on each line of the data file.  The DFFT data element and corrected frequency are separated by a space\n! Obtained the corrected frequency based on the sampe rate and the next power of two of the total number of samples (i.e. 100 samples -> next power of 2 = 128.)\n! Since there are num_bins_int number of data elements in FFT array, and the FFT array is symmetric, we divide the magnitude by half the num_bins_int to get the normalized magnitude.\n!\n! Version 5\n! Commented out debug code and rearranged some inconsequential lines.\n!\n! 2015\n! Version 4\n! Numerous fixes.  Changed code to allocate memory based on the next power of 2 relative\n! to the number of element in the input file.  For example, a data file with 1000 data elements\n! will cause arrays to be allocated with 1024 elements.  This is done to prevent errors in the FFT.\n! Extra array space above and beyond what is in data file is padded with zeros.\n! Reformatted most of the debug output.\n! Used ATAN2, separate variables and formatting to ensure that small values of the real part will not \n! cause phase errors.\n!\n! Version 3\n! This version counts the number of data elements in the file automatically.\n!

ECAs consist of a one-dimensional grid of cells, each in one of two states (0 or 1, often visualized as empty or filled). The state of each cell evolves over discrete time steps based on a rule that considers the cell itself and its immediate neighbors (left and right, for a total of 3 cells per “neighborhood”).\n\nThe code is divided into two main parts:\n\nA module named cellular_automata_mod, which defines the data structures, initialization logic, rule application, stepping mechanism, and printing functions for the automaton.\n\nA program named cellular_automata, which serves as the main entry point. It reads parameters (optionally from command-line arguments), initializes the automaton, prints the rules, and simulates the evolution over a specified number of steps, printing each state.\n\nKey features:\n\nSupports Wolfram’s rule numbering system (0–255 for 3-neighbor rules).\n\nCells are initialized randomly (50% chance of being 1 or 0).\n\nThe grid is treated as circular (the leftmost cell’s left neighbor is the rightmost cell, and vice versa), which is evident in the stepping logic.\n\nOutput: Prints the rule set, then each generation’s state as a line of ‘X’ (for 1) or ’ ’ (for 0).\n\nDefaults: Rule 90, 50 cells, 100 steps, but can be overridden via command-line arguments.\n\nThe code uses modern Fortran features like modules, derived types, implicit none for safety, and intrinsic modules like iso_fortran_env for error handling. It assumes a fixed neighborhood size of 3 (left, self, right), leading to 8 possible neighborhood configurations (2^3 = 8 rules).\n\nNow, I’ll break it down section by section, explaining the code line by line where appropriate.","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/fortran-mooc/section-cellular-automata#overview-of-the-code","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section: Cellular Automata","lvl3":"The Module: cellular_automata_mod","lvl2":"Code Analysis by Grok 4"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/fortran-mooc/section-cellular-automata#the-module-cellular-automata-mod","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section: Cellular Automata","lvl3":"The Module: cellular_automata_mod","lvl2":"Code Analysis by Grok 4"},"content":"This module encapsulates all the logic for the automaton.

This code uses in-place update with left-to-right sweep, which for circular grids can work but may not be standard simultaneous update.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the program works:\n\nVariable Declaration: The program begins by declaring the necessary variables:\n\ni and n are integers used for looping and setting the upper limit, respectively.\n\nSumOfSqrs and SqrOfSums are initialized to zero. They are used to store the sum of squares and the square of sums, respectively.\n\ndifference is declared to store the computed difference between the two calculated values.\n\nUser Interface Messages: The program uses write statements to print messages to the user explaining what the program does. These messages are:\n\n“This program calculates the difference between sum of squares and square of sums.”\n\nInput Handling: Originally, the program likely had code to prompt the user to enter the value of n (number of terms). In this specific version, the user input is commented out, and n is set to 100 directly in the code. This adjustment might be for simplification, especially in environments like Jupyter Notebooks where interactive inputs can be cumbersome.\n\nComputation Loop:\n\nThe program uses a do loop from 1 to n. Inside this loop:\n\nIt calculates the sum of squares (SumOfSqrs) by adding the square of each number i to the existing sum.\n\nIt also calculates the sum of the numbers (SqrOfSums) by adding each number i to the cumulative sum.\n\nFinal Calculation:\n\nAfter exiting the loop, it squares the total sum (SqrOfSums) to get the square of the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.\n\nIt calculates the difference by subtracting the sum of squares from the square of sums.\n\nResult Display: Finally, the program prints the results:\n\nIt displays the square of the sums.\n\nIt displays the sum of the squares.\n\nIt displays the computed difference between these two values.\n\nThis program highlights a classic mathematical problem often used to demonstrate algebraic identities or computational capabilities in programming.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/intro-to-fortran/section-9-3-sos-difference#program-to-calculate-the-difference-between-the-sum-of-squares-and-the-square-of-sums","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 9.3: Difference Between Sum of Squares and Square of Sums","lvl2":"Program Compilation and Execution"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/intro-to-fortran/section-9-3-sos-difference#program-compilation-and-execution","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 9.3: Difference Between Sum of Squares and Square of Sums","lvl2":"Program Compilation and Execution"},"content":"\n\nThe above program is compiled and run using Fortran Package Manager (fpm):\n\nimport os\nroot_dir = os.getcwd()\n\n\n\ncode_dir = root_dir + \"/\" + \"Fortran_Code/Section_9_3_SOS_Difference\"\n\n\n\nos.chdir(code_dir)\n\n\n\nbuild_status = os.system(\"fpm build 2>/dev/null\")\n\n\n\nexec_status = os.system(\"fpm run 2>/dev/null\")\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/intro-to-fortran/section-9-3-sos-difference#program-compilation-and-execution","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to Fortran"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/intro-to-fortran/intro-to-fortran-head","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to Fortran"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/intro-to-fortran/intro-to-fortran-head","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to Fortran","lvl2":"Introduction"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/computer-programming/fortran/intro-to-fortran/intro-to-fortran-head#introduction","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to Fortran","lvl2":"Introduction"},"content":"In this section we will be following along with the examples from \"\n\nIntroduction to Programming Using Fortran 95/2003/2008\" by Ed Jorgensen (March 2018 / Version 3.0.51).

The _DP suffix ensures double-precision literals.\n\nPrecomputing r_squared:\n\nr_squared = r*r: Stores 1.0 for use in the distance check inside the loop.\n\nGetting Number of Trials:\n\nnum_trials = get_nr_iters(): Calls the function from get_nr_iters_mod to read the number of iterations. If no command-line argument is provided, it defaults to 1000.\n\nMonte Carlo Loop:\n\ndo i = 1, num_trials: A simple do-loop that runs num_trials times.\n\nx = lcgrandom(): Generates a pseudo-random number in [0,1) for the x-coordinate.\n\ny = lcgrandom(): Same for y-coordinate.\n\nif ((x*x + y*y) <= r_squared) then: Checks if the point (x,y) is inside the quarter-circle by testing if the squared distance from origin (x² + y²) ≤ 1.0.\n\nIf true, Ncirc = Ncirc + 1: Increments the counter.\n\nThis implements the core Monte Carlo method: the probability a random point in the unit square falls inside the quarter-circle is π/4, so π ≈ 4 * (Ncirc / num_trials).\n\nComputing the Approximation:\n\npi_computed = 4.0*((1.0*Ncirc)/(1.0*num_trials)): Calculates the estimate.

The neural network was implemented in Fortran using the Neural Fortran library. The data was written to a CSV file using the CSV Fortran library. The neural network predictions and mean squared error were plotted using Python.\n\nAs can be seen from the plot, the neural network was able to approximate the sine function quite well. The mean squared error decreased over time as the neural network was trained. This example demonstrates how neural networks can be used to approximate complex functions such as the sine function.\n\nAs the iteration number reached 100,000, the neural network predictions closely matched the true sine wave function. The mean squared error decreased over time as the neural network was trained. This example demonstrates how neural networks can be used to approximate complex functions such as the sine function.\n\nA great improvement on this code would be to implement the training loop using OpenMP.

In this case, 10 is an abbreviation for an actual slider widget:IntSlider(min=-10, max=30, step=1, value=10)\n\nIn fact, we can get the same result if we pass this IntSlider as the keyword argument for x:\n\ninteract(f, x=widgets.IntSlider(min=-10, max=30, step=1, value=10));\n\n\n\nThe following table gives an overview of different argument types, and how they map to interactive controls:\n\nKeyword argument\n\nWidget\n\n`True` or `False`\n\nCheckbox\n\n`'Hi there'`\n\nText\n\n`value` or `(min,max)` or `(min,max,step)` if integers are passed\n\nIntSlider\n\n`value` or `(min,max)` or `(min,max,step)` if floats are passed\n\nFloatSlider\n\n`['orange','apple']` or `[('one', 1), ('two', 2)]\n\nDropdown\n\nNote that a dropdown is used if a list or a list of tuples is given (signifying discrete choices), and a slider is used if a tuple is given (signifying a range).\n\nYou have seen how the checkbox and text widgets work above. Here, more details about the different abbreviations for sliders and dropdowns are given.\n\nIf a 2-tuple of integers is passed (min, max), an integer-valued slider is produced with those minimum and maximum values (inclusively). In this case, the default step size of 1 is used.\n\ninteract(f, x=(0,4));\n\n\n\nIf a 3-tuple of integers is passed (min,max,step), the step size can also be set.\n\ninteract(f, x=(0,8,2));\n\n\n\nA float-valued slider is produced if any of the elements of the tuples are floats. Here the minimum is 0.0, the maximum is 10.0 and step size is 0.1 (the default).\n\ninteract(f, x=(0.0,10.0));\n\n\n\nThe step size can be changed by passing a third element in the tuple.\n\ninteract(f, x=(0.0,10.0,0.01));\n\n\n\nFor both integer and float-valued sliders, you can pick the initial value of the widget by passing a default keyword argument to the underlying Python function. Here we set the initial value of a float slider to 5.5.\n\n@interact(x=(0.0,20.0,0.5))\ndef h(x=5.5):\n    return x\n\n\n\nDropdown menus are constructed by passing a list of strings. In this case, the strings are both used as the names in the dropdown menu UI and passed to the underlying Python function.\n\ninteract(f, x=['apples','oranges']);\n\n\n\nIf you want a dropdown menu that passes non-string values to the Python function, you can pass a list of ('label', value) pairs. The first items are the names in the dropdown menu UI and the second items are values that are the arguments passed to the underlying Python function.\n\ninteract(f, x=[('one', 10), ('two', 20)]);\n\n\n\nFinally, if you need more granular control than that afforded by the abbreviation, you can pass a ValueWidget instance as the argument. A ValueWidget is a widget that aims to control a single value. Most of the widgets \n\nbundled with ipywidgets inherit from ValueWidget. For more information, see this section on widget types.\nAlso see the \n\nIPyWidgets Interact Documentation for more general information.\n\ninteract(f, x=widgets.Combobox(options=[\"Chicago\", \"New York\", \"Washington\"], value=\"Chicago\"));\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/jupyter-widgets/using-interact#widget-abbreviations","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"IPyWidgets: Using Interact","lvl2":"Type Annotations"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/computer-programming/jupyter-widgets/using-interact#type-annotations","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"IPyWidgets: Using Interact","lvl2":"Type Annotations"},"content":"\n\nIf the function that you are using with interact uses type annotations, interact may be able to use those to determine what UI components to use in the auto-generated UI.

In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam_amount to refer to a different sort of thing like a string or a boolean.\n\nprint(spam_amount)\n\n\n\nFunction calls:. print is a Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, and putting the inputs (or arguments) to the function in those parentheses.\n\n# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)\nspam_amount = spam_amount + 4\n\n\n\nThe first line above is a comment. In Python, comments begin with the # symbol.\n\nNext we see an example of reassignment. Reassigning the value of an existing variable looks just the same as creating a variable - it still uses the = assignment operator.\n\nIn this case, the value we’re assigning to spam_amount involves some simple arithmetic on its previous value. When it encounters this line, Python evaluates the expression on the right-hand-side of the = (0 + 4 = 4), and then assigns that value to the variable on the left-hand-side.\n\nif spam_amount > 0:\n    print(\"But I don't want ANY spam!\")\n\nviking_song = \"Spam Spam Spam\"\nprint(viking_song)\n\n\n\nWe won’t talk much about “conditionals” until later, but, even if you’ve never coded before, you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity.\n\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the if. \"But I don't want ANY spam!\" is only supposed to be printed if spam_amount is positive. But the later code (like print(viking_song)) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (:) at the end of the if line indicates that a new code block is starting. Subsequent lines which are indented are part of that code block.\n\nNote\n\n: If you’ve coded before, you might know that some other languages use {curly braces} to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python’s use of meaningful whitespace can be surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks.\n\nThe later lines dealing with viking_song are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they’re not a part of the if’s code block. We’ll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we define functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a string in Python:\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string contains a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we’re careful.)\n\nviking_song = \"Spam \" * spam_amount\nprint(viking_song)\n\n\n\nThe * operator can be used to multiply two numbers (3 * 3 evaluates to 9), but we can also multiply a string by a number, to get a version that’s been repeated that many times. Python offers a number of cheeky little time-saving tricks like this where operators like * and + have a different meaning depending on what kind of thing they’re applied to. (The technical term for this is \n\noperator overloading.)\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/kaggle/python/python-tutorial/python-tutorial#hello-python","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Python Tutorial: Hello, Python!","lvl3":"Numbers and arithmetic in Python"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/computer-programming/kaggle/python/python-tutorial/python-tutorial#numbers-and-arithmetic-in-python","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Python Tutorial: Hello, Python!","lvl3":"Numbers and arithmetic in Python"},"content":"We’ve already seen an example of a variable containing a number above:\n\nspam_amount = 0\n\n\n\n“Number” is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that spam_amount is:\n\ntype(spam_amount)\n\n\n\nIt’s an int - short for integer. There’s another sort of number we commonly encounter in Python:\n\ntype(19.95)\n\n\n\nA float is a number with a decimal place - very useful for representing things like weights or proportions.\n\ntype() is the second built-in function we’ve seen (after print()), and it’s another good one to remember. It’s very useful to be able to ask Python “what kind of thing is this?”.\n\nA natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic. We’ve seen the + operator for addition, and the * operator for multiplication. Python also has us covered for the rest of the basic buttons on your calculator:\n\nOperator\n\nName\n\nDescription\n\na + b\n\nAddition\n\nSum of a and b\n\na - b\n\nSubtraction\n\nDifference of a and b\n\na * b\n\nMultiplication\n\nProduct of a and b\n\na / b\n\nTrue division\n\nQuotient of a and b\n\na // b\n\nFloor division\n\nQuotient of a and b, removing fractional parts\n\na % b\n\nModulus\n\nInteger remainder after division of a by b\n\na ** b\n\nExponentiation\n\na raised to the power of b\n\n-a\n\nNegation\n\nThe negative of a\n\n\n\nOne interesting observation here is that, whereas your calculator probably just has one button for division, Python can do two kinds. “True division” is basically what your calculator does:\n\nprint(5 / 2)\nprint(6 / 2)\n\n\n\nIt always gives us a float.\n\nThe // operator gives us a result that’s rounded down to the next integer.\n\nprint(5 // 2)\nprint(6 // 2)\n\n\n\nCan you think of where this would be useful? You’ll see an example soon in the coding challenges.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/kaggle/python/python-tutorial/python-tutorial#numbers-and-arithmetic-in-python","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Python Tutorial: Hello, Python!","lvl4":"Order of operations","lvl3":"Numbers and arithmetic in Python"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/computer-programming/kaggle/python/python-tutorial/python-tutorial#order-of-operations","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Python Tutorial: Hello, Python!","lvl4":"Order of operations","lvl3":"Numbers and arithmetic in Python"},"content":"The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated.

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time (or “tick”), the following transitions occur:\n\nUnderpopulation: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n\nSurvival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n\nOverpopulation: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n\nReproduction: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules are applied simultaneously to every cell in the grid, with births and deaths occurring simultaneously. The initial pattern constitutes the ‘seed’ of the system. The first generation is created by applying the rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, and this results in the creation of a second generation of cells. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/python/python-playground/section-chapter-3-conway#rules","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3: Conway’s Game of Life","lvl3":"Characteristics and Complexity","lvl2":"ChatGPT 4.0 Output"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/computer-programming/python/python-playground/section-chapter-3-conway#characteristics-and-complexity","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3: Conway’s Game of Life","lvl3":"Characteristics and Complexity","lvl2":"ChatGPT 4.0 Output"},"content":"Patterns: Conway’s Game of Life is known for its various patterns, some of which are stable, oscillate between states, or move across the grid (spaceships).\n\nTuring Completeness: Remarkably, the Game of Life is Turing complete, meaning that it can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

Here’s how it works:\n\nInitial Noise Burst: The algorithm starts with a buffer (wavetable) filled with random values. This buffer represents a noise burst, similar to the initial complex vibrations when a string is plucked.\n\nCircular Buffer Feedback Loop: The buffer is treated as a circular buffer, meaning that once the playback reaches the end of the buffer, it wraps around to the start again. The contents of this buffer are continuously fed back into itself, creating a feedback loop.\n\nLow-Pass Filter: Each time the buffer wraps around, the algorithm applies a simple low-pass filtering process. This usually involves averaging each sample with the next one (or with a small number of subsequent samples). This filtering simulates the energy loss in a real string due to factors like air resistance and internal friction.\n\nResulting Sound: The output sound is created by continuously reading the values from this buffer. The low-pass filtering gradually turns the initial noise into a harmonic wave, mimicking the behavior of a vibrating string.","type":"content","url":"/sections/computer-programming/python/python-playground/section-chapter-4-karplus-strong#basic-concept","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 4: Karplus Strong Algorithm","lvl3":"Characteristics and Usage","lvl2":"ChatGPT 4.0 Output"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/computer-programming/python/python-playground/section-chapter-4-karplus-strong#characteristics-and-usage","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 4: Karplus Strong Algorithm","lvl3":"Characteristics and Usage","lvl2":"ChatGPT 4.0 Output"},"content":"Realism and Simplicity: The Karplus-Strong algorithm is renowned for its ability to produce realistic string-like sounds with a very simple implementation, making it computationally efficient.\n\nModifications for Different Sounds: The algorithm can be modified to simulate different types of plucked string instruments.

This is a vulnerability in the way the kernel and C compiler handles function calls, because shellcode can be inserted onto the stack and the saved return address may be overwritten to point to the shellcode. However, as seen in the section on Shellcoding, modern kernels will not allow execution of data on the stack. So even though this vulnerability has for the most part been patched, we will still learn it because fundamentally, it is the basis for many such vulnerabilities, found even in modern kernels.\n\nWe will now investigate exploiting this vulnerability with a simple vulnerable C test program called meet.c shown below.\n\nThe vulnerable C program: meet.c#include <stdio.h>                              // needed for screen printing\n#include <string.h>\n\nvoid greeting (char * temp1, char * temp2) {    // greeting function to say hello\n    char name[400];                             // string variable to hold name\n    printf (\"The address of the name array is: %p\\n\", (void*) &name);\t\t// for diagnostics\n    printf (\"The address of temp1 is: %p\\n\", (void*) &temp1);\t\t\t// for diagnostics\n    printf (\"The address of temp2 is: %p\\n\", (void*) &temp2);\t\t\t// for diagnostics\n    strcpy (name, temp2);                       // copy the function argumemt to name\n    printf (\"Hello %s %s\\n\", temp1, name);      // print out the greeting\n}\n\nvoid main (int argc, char * argv[]) {           // note the format for the argumemts\n    greeting (argv[1], argv[2]);                // call function, pass title and name\n    printf (\"Bye %s %s\\n\", argv[1], argv[2]);   // say \"bye\"\n}                                               // exit program\n\nClick here to download meet.c","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#smashing-the-stack-of-a-vulnerable-program-and-causing-a-buffer-overflow","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Brief synopsis of meet.c","lvl2":"Resources Used"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#brief-synopsis-of-meet-c","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Brief synopsis of meet.c","lvl2":"Resources Used"},"content":"In the program meet.c, we include string.h in order to make use of the vulnerable strcpy command. The format of the strcpy command is as follows:char * strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);\n\nFrom the man page for strcpy:\n\nThe strcpy() function copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (‘\\0’), to the buffer pointed to by dest. The strings may not overlap, and the destination string dest must be large enough to receive the copy. Beware of buffer overruns!\n\nThe program’s main function reads in two arguments, which are stored in the argv array of strings. They are argv[1] and argv[2] for the first and second arguments, respectively.\n\nThe main function calls a function called greeting. Greeting has a local variable that is 400 bytes long called name. This local variable acts like an input buffer. In order to aid in understanding the memory layout of this program, I have added three diagnostic statements that print out the memory addresses of the local variable name, as well as the two function arguments, temp1 and temp2.\n\nNow this is where things get interesting. For educational purposes, the VERY vulnerable strcpy function is called from within the function called greeting. What strcpy will do is to copy the argument temp2 into the buffer name, WITHOUT any bounds checking. This means that if the argument temp2 is carefully crafted, the buffer name can be overflowed. When it is overflowed, it will overwrite adjacent data, which includes the return address to the calling function main!\n\nNormally used, the function called greeting then prints out the string Hello, followed by the first argument, and the contents of the buffer called name. Control is then returned back to the main function, which prints out the string, Bye, followed by the first and second arguments from the command line. We will now investigate attacking the aforementioned built-in vulnerability in this program. But first, we must set up the environment.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#brief-synopsis-of-meet-c","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Disabling Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)","lvl2":"Resources Used"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#disabling-address-space-layout-randomization-aslr","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Disabling Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)","lvl2":"Resources Used"},"content":"As mentioned previously, modern Linux kernels use several strategies to overcome vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. One of these strategies is known as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Essentially, the kernel randomizes the process’s address space, which includes the stack, thereby precluding the ability to brute force overwriting of the stored return address on the stack. Every attempt will require injection of a new malicious address that points back to the shellcode. This is extremely difficult to guess, if not impossible.\n\nAnother strategy is to simply not allow execution of data on the stack. Since the buffer and hence the injected shellcode resides entirely on the stack, execution of the shellcode will not be allowed by the kernel, and the process will crash.\n\nTo get around such protections, for pedagogical reasons, we will disable both ASLR and allow execution of data on the stack. This will require either recompiling the C program with executable stack or enabling executable stack at the kernel level. In order to disable ASLR, a bash shell may be opened with the following command:$ setarch i386 -R /bin/bash\n\nor by disabling ASLR at the kernel level. To minimize variables, it is better to do this at the kernel level; however, this is not a good idea on your main system for security reasons. Therefore, we will spin up a 32-bit Ubuntu virtual machine and disable these protections at the kernel level, as shown in the image below:\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Disabling ASLR in the 32-bit Ubuntu Virtual Machine\n\nAs can be seen from the screenshot above, it is not directly possible to disable non-executable stack or data execution protections, also called NX. This must be done at the UEFI or BIOS level. It is however, possible to disable ASLR by using the command:$ echo \"0\"> /proc/sys/kernel/randomize\\_va\\_space\n\nIn order test that the process’ address space is not randomized, we issue the following command a few times and observe that the address space is constant between issuing the command:$ cat /proc/self/maps\n\n[.... memory layout table ....]$ cat /proc/self/maps\n\n[.... unchanged memory layout table ....]$ cat /proc/self/maps\n\n[.... unchanged memory layout table ....]\n\nThe following screenshot shows these commands in the 32-bit Ubuntu VM:\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Process memory map showing no randomization of address space layout\n\nAs can be seen from the above screenshot, the address space layout is not randomized. Each invocation of the cat /proc/self/maps command produces the same results. Of particular interest is that the stack’s address remains constant at:\n\nbffdf000-c0000000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]\n\nNotice that the stack has permissions of rw, but not exectute.\n\nIn order to overcome the inability to disable non-executable (NX) stack or data segments at the kernel level, we will have to remember to issue special directives to the compiler when compiling vulnerable programs. These compiler directives are:gcc ..._\\-zexecstack -fno-stack-protector_...\n\nThe directive -zexecstack tells the compiler to enable an executable stack, while the directive -fno-stack-protector tells the compiler to disable stack corruption protections.\n\nWe are now ready to attempt to overflow the buffer of the vulnerable program from the command line.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#disabling-address-space-layout-randomization-aslr","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl2":"Smashing the Stack of a Vulnerable Program and Causing a Buffer Overflow - Overflowing the Buffer of the Vulnerable Program meet.c"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#smashing-the-stack-of-a-vulnerable-program-and-causing-a-buffer-overflow-overflowing-the-buffer-of-the-vulnerable-program-meet-c","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl2":"Smashing the Stack of a Vulnerable Program and Causing a Buffer Overflow - Overflowing the Buffer of the Vulnerable Program meet.c"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#smashing-the-stack-of-a-vulnerable-program-and-causing-a-buffer-overflow-overflowing-the-buffer-of-the-vulnerable-program-meet-c","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Compiling meet.c with NX disabled, with debugging information and static compilation","lvl2":"Smashing the Stack of a Vulnerable Program and Causing a Buffer Overflow - Overflowing the Buffer of the Vulnerable Program meet.c"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#compiling-meet-c-with-nx-disabled-with-debugging-information-and-static-compilation","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Compiling meet.c with NX disabled, with debugging information and static compilation","lvl2":"Smashing the Stack of a Vulnerable Program and Causing a Buffer Overflow - Overflowing the Buffer of the Vulnerable Program meet.c"},"content":"As described in the previous section, it is first necessary to compile meet.c with executable stack protections off.

Since we will be running the executable on a 32-bit Virtual Machine (VM), this might be a moot point, but we will do it anyway to minimize differences in executable operation among different systems.\n\nTo compile meet.c, we issue the following command:gcc -m32 -static -ggdb3 -zexecstack -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 meet.c -o meet\n\nThe results of this command are shown in the image below:\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Compiling meet.c statically, with NX disabled and extensive debugging information\n\nThe command we used to compile meet.c had the following arguments:\n\nArgument\n\nMeaning\n\n-m32\n\nCompile into 32-bit mode.\n\n-static\n\nCompile the program statically, with all libraries included within the executable.\n\n-ggdb3\n\nInclude maximum debugging information.\n\n-zexecstack\n\nAllow an executable stack.

Actually, we could have tried the first argument, but we would have found that the first argument is very resilient, since it is not actually taking part in the vulnerable strcpy command. This could have been surmised from reverse engineering the binary, if the source code was not available. Below we show what happens even when we inject 500 “A”'s into the first argument. In the second image, we will attempt to insert 2000 “A”'s and see what happens.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Attempt at fuzzing first argument with 500 “A”'s into the executable meet\n\nIn the figure above, we first try 10 “A”'s and then 500 “A”'s, and nothing seems to break. Again, this is because only the second argument participates in the vulnerable strcpy command. To make absolutely sure, in the figure below, we inject 2000 “A”'s into the first argument of the executable meet.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:Attempt at fuzzing first argument with 2000 “A”'s into the executable meet\n\nIn the figure above, nothing seems to break. We therefore focus on the second argument. Our goal is to find the size of the vulnerable buffer, so we start low and work our way up until we encounter a segmentation fault. This fault will indicate that our input has overwritten the return address of the the main function within the executable meet.\n\n\n\nFigure 8:Attempt at fuzzing the second argument with an increasing number of “A”'s into the executable meet\n\nStill no segmentation faults. We continue increasing the number of “A”'s in the figure below.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:Segmentation fault found!\n\nWe can see that we have found the segmentation fault after injecting 400 “A”'s into the second argument. 398 and 399 did not do it. From this we can surmise that the first argument “Mr” took two bytes and the second argument took 400 bytes, and this was enough to overwrite the main function’s return address. Since the saved base pointer took four bytes and the saved return address took an additional four bytes, we have probably overwritten the saved base pointer, at which the main function used this corrupted base pointer for its stack frame operations. But since we have corrupted the saved base pointer, the program tried to access an invalid part of memory, and hence we obtained the segmentation fault.\n\nFrom this we can surmise that the vulnerable buffer size is about 400 bytes. Let us fire up the Gnu DeBugger on the segmentation fault and see what happened. Before we do this, we install the PEDA extension for GDB to make life easier. This can be found at:\n\nPython Exploit Development Assistance\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Finding root cause of the segmentation fault\n\nWe can see from GDB that the exact instruction that caused the segmentation fault was found at the address main+35:[-------------------------------------code-------------------------------------]\n   0x8048903 <main+26>:\tadd    esp,0x8\n   0x8048906 <main+29>:\tmov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]\n   0x8048909 <main+32>:\tadd    eax,0x8\n=> 0x804890c <main+35>:\tmov    edx,DWORD PTR [eax]\n   0x804890e <main+37>:\tmov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]\n   0x8048911 <main+40>:\tadd    eax,0x4\n   0x8048914 <main+43>:\tmov    eax,DWORD PTR [eax]\n   0x8048916 <main+45>:\tpush   edx\n\nThe instruction attempted to load into EDX the contents of the memory address pointed to by EAX. We can observe that the contents of the registers was:[----------------------------------registers-----------------------------------]\nEAX: 0x41414149 ('IAAA')\nEBX: 0x80481a8 (<_init>:\tpush   ebx)\nECX: 0x7ffffe66 \nEDX: 0x80eb4d4 --> 0x0 \nESI: 0x80ea00c --> 0x8066fc0 (<__strcpy_sse2>:\tmov    edx,DWORD PTR [esp+0x4])\nEDI: 0x45 ('E')\nEBP: 0xbfffed00 ('A' <repeats 184 times>)\nESP: 0xbfffedc8 --> 0x0 \nEIP: 0x804890c (<main+35>:\tmov    edx,DWORD PTR [eax])\nEFLAGS: 0x10202 (carry parity adjust zero sign trap INTERRUPT direction overflow)\n\nLooking specifically at EAX, it contained 0x41414149. 0x41 is the ASCII code for the capital A. We can see that when the CPU tried to access the contents of the memory location pointed to by EAX, we got the segmentation fault. This is because the memory address 0x41414149 is outside of the program’s allowable access segments.\n\nWhat appears to have happened is that the return address was not overwritten, because the program was able to return to main. However, it appears that argc and argv where overwritten by the buffer overflow. Recall that argc contains the number of arguments, including the command itself. In our case, argc would have been 2, since it starts at 0.  Recall that the name of the executable corresponds to argc = 0, the second argument corresponds to argc = 1, and the the fuzzing string (i.e. the 400 “A”'s) corresponds to argc = 2.\n\nargv[ ] is an array of strings. Each string in argv are the arguments, where argv[0] is the command itself. In our case, argv[1] would have been “Mr” and argv[2] would have been 400 “A”'s. What we are really after is to overwrite EIP. To do that, we will have to add an additional 8 \"A\"s, which equals a total of 8 bytes. 4 of those bytes will overwrite the saved EBP, and the other 4 bytes will overwrite the saved EIP. We show the results of running meet with 408 “A”'s for the second argument in the screen shot below:\n\n\n\nFigure 11:Overwriting EIP by injecting 408 “A”'s into the second argument to the executable meet\n\nNow that we have found a way to overwrite EIP, we can basically get the CPU to execute arbitrary code within the processes memory segment. If we could insert shellcode into the second argument, and then overwrite the return address to point to the start of the shellcode, then we will cause the process to spawn a shell. If this process was running under root privileges, then the shell will be a root shell, where we can basically control the entire system. Let us try to do this from the command line.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#fuzzing-the-inputs-to-the-executable-meet","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Inserting Shellcode into a Vulnerable Processs from the Command Line to Obtain a Command Shell","lvl2":"Smashing the Stack of a Vulnerable Program and Causing a Buffer Overflow - Overflowing the Buffer of the Vulnerable Program meet.c"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#inserting-shellcode-into-a-vulnerable-processs-from-the-command-line-to-obtain-a-command-shell","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Inserting Shellcode into a Vulnerable Processs from the Command Line to Obtain a Command Shell","lvl2":"Smashing the Stack of a Vulnerable Program and Causing a Buffer Overflow - Overflowing the Buffer of the Vulnerable Program meet.c"},"content":"In this section, our goal is to try to insert shellcode into the vulnerable executable meet.

In order to show how dramatic such an attack can be, we will escalate the privileges of the vulnerable program to that of super user (SUID). This will cause the vulnerable program to drop out of normal execution and into a command shell with root privileges.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:Changing the execution privileges of the executable meet to SUID\n\nBy issuing the command:sudo chmod u+s meet\n\nwe give the executable meet the privileges to execute at the root level.\n\nDO NOT LEAVE A VULNERABLE EXECUTABLE WITH SUID ROOT PRIVILEGES ON YOUR SYSTEM AFTER YOU ARE DONE!

By doing so, we hijacked the instruction pointer EIP to execute our arbitrary code. In this case, our arbitrary code was shellcode, which provides a command shell.

The quotation marks on the outside, i.e. “$()” tell the command shell to treat everything within the quotes as a literal string. See below for examples:\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Demonstration of the effect of quotation marks at the Linux command prompt\n\nAs can be seen from the above screen shot, putting separated commands into quotes causes everything contained within the quotes to be treated as a single string. This is a good property for injecting shellcode from the command line into a vulnerable executable.\n\nWe will now examine using $() and “$()” on the command line.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:Using $() and “$()” on command line\n\nAs can be seen from the screenshot above, putting commands separated by a semicolon within $(), causes the the output of the commands to be substituted into their place and the output to be executed by the shell.

That is why the shell returns an error in the screenshot above.\n\nWe will now put these concepts together to craft an attack string.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#use-of-the-cmd-cmd-cmd-cmd-format","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Using “$()” to craft an attack string","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#using-to-craft-an-attack-string","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Using “$()” to craft an attack string","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"content":"We begin by using two shell commands:perl -e 'perl command'  \n   \nxxd filename\n\nThese commands can be broken down as follows:\n\nCommand\n\nMeaning\n\nperl -e ‘perl command’\n\nExecute perl command contained within the single quotes\n\nxxd filename\n\nDisplay the hexadecimal values of the characters contained within the file called filename\n\nWe will now use these commands to craft an attack string.\n\nWe will craft an attack string using perl commands and pipe the output of the attack string into xxd, to see whether the hexadecimal values align properly in memory and do not contain any bad characters, such a null byte, i.e. \\x00, or the linefeed character, i.e. \\x0a. The null byte is bad because many string processing functions in C interpret the null byte as the end of the string. So if our attack string contains a null byte in the middle of it, then only a portion of the attack string will enter into the vulnerable function. This will cause the attack string to fail. Likewise, the linefeed character will cause the parsing units of the string manipulation functions to interpret the linefeed as a user hitting the enter key. This will again cause premature failure of the attack string.\n\nLet us try a simple example, such as:\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Example of piping data into xxd to observe the hexadecimal values of the characters\n\nIn the above screenshot, we use the echo command to take the entire output of the commands within the “$()” and echo it to the screen. However, since we are using the unix pipe, the output is instead piped to the xxd command, which displays the hexadecimal values of the characters. Notice that there is a problem right at the end. There is a 0x0a character, which is the linefeed that the echo command affixes to the end. To suppress this trailing linefeed, the -n switch is used with the echo command. In the second issuance of the echo command, the trailing linefeed is suppressed, and we get a nice collection of hexadecimal values to fill 64 spots.\n\nWe can now move forward with constructing the attack string.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#using-to-craft-an-attack-string","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Putting it all together","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#putting-it-all-together","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Putting it all together","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"content":"Recall that the attack string was:sudo ./meet mr \"$(perl -e 'print \"\\\\x90\"x200'; cat sc; perl -e 'print \"\\\\x90\"x27' ;perl -e 'print \"\\\\x18\\\\xf2\\\\xff\\\\xbf\"x38')\"\n\nWe will focus on everything contained within the “$()” by piping it into xxd and seeing what we are actually putting into the vulnerable buffer.\n\n\n\nFigure 17:Piping the attack string into xxd\n\nFrom the above screenshot, we can see that the attack string contains a prologue of 0x90 characters. The 0x90 is the hexadecimal value of the opcode for No OPeration, or the NOP. Since the CPU can not distingush data from executable code, the CPU begins executing the data as if it were code. This prologue of NOP instructions is called a NOP sled. The NOP sled is used to make it easier by relieving the requirement to be absolutely exact with the return address at the end of the attack string. The CPU’s instruction pointer needs to be made to fall anywhere within this NOP sled, so that it will begin sliding down the NOP sled and eventually hit the shellcode. We have highlighted the shellcode for clarity. The shellcode was developed within another section of this website and can be found here:\n\nShellcode Generation and Testing\n\nHow can we make the CPU’s instruction pointer point to somewhere in the NOP sled? This is where real hacking skill comes in. After the NOP sled and shellcode, we need to overflow the rest of the buffer with the memory address of the buffer.\n\nFrom where do we get this address? In our case, we have access to the source code and debugging information. Without the source code and debugging information, we would need to engage in reverse engineering of the executable. This is not impossible, but obviously much harder to do. For our purposes here, we will work on the easier case of knowing the exact memory address of the buffer we wish to overflow.\n\nIn our easier case, there are two ways of finding out the memory address of the buffer we wish to overflow.\n\nModifiying the source code to print out the memory address of the buffer.\n\nUsing the debugger GDB to find out the memory address of the buffer.\n\nThis may seem to easy to many of you, and indeed it is. So we will also explore trying to overflow the buffer when knowing only the location of the stack pointer.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#putting-it-all-together","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Discovering the memory address of the buffer we wish to overflow","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#discovering-the-memory-address-of-the-buffer-we-wish-to-overflow","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Discovering the memory address of the buffer we wish to overflow","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"content":"We now explore how to discover the memory address of the buffer we wish to overflow. Recall that when running the vulnerable executable meet with normal inputs, we obtain the following output:\n\n\n\nFigure 18:Running meet.c normally\n\nWe can see from the above screenshot that the memory address of the buffer that we want to overflow is:The address of the name array is: 0xbfffee28\n\nThe memory address 0xbfffee28 is what we need to append to the end of the shellcode enough times so that this address will overwrite the saved EIP. By doing so, when the CPU reaches the ret assembly instruction as it leaves the called function greeting, it will load the instruction pointer with the memory address 0xbfffee28, and then begin execution of the instructions there. Those instructions are the NOP sled, followed by our shellcode!\n\nOf course, it is not always that simple. This address needs to be four byte aligned and input into the attack string in reverse order, since memory in IA32 is written in Little-Endian format. So in the case of 0xbfffee28, we would write it as \\x28\\xee\\xff\\xbf. In order to align the address to 4 bytes, we will need to add some NOP instruction padding so that the address 0xbfffee28 does not sit in the next byte location in memory after the shellcode, but rather in a fresh new 32 bit (4 byte) location. Otherwise, this address will be a shifted version of itself when the CPU tries to read it off of the stack. In that case, the address may be read as 0xee28bfff or 0xffee28bf. I both of those cases, the program will most certainly crash with an out of bounds or illegal instruction segmentation fault.\n\nNote that this address may change slightly with each execution of the program meet; therefore, some persistance is necessary when attacking from the command line. We will now explore using the debugger GDB for finding out the address of the buffer we want to overflow. Refer to the screenshot below:\n\n\n\nFigure 19:Discovering the memory address of the buffer we want to overflow. The buffer is called “name”\n\nWe can see from the GEF User Interface (UI) to GDB that we are at the vulnerable strcpy function:strcpy (name, temp2); // copy the function argumemt to name\n\nBy the C calling convention, arguments passed to a function are pushed onto the stack in reverse order. We can see from the screenshot that temp1 is at ESP+8, ESP+4 contains the memory address of temp2 and at ESP we have the memory address of the local variable name. In this case, the memory address is 0xbfffea58. Note that we are looking for the memory address of the local variable name, NOT what the register ESP (stack pointer) points to, but rather what is at the memory address that the ESP points to. In other words, ESP points to an address on the stack, 0xbfffea50, and at this memory address, there is stored another memory address which is 0xbfffea58. The contents of the memory location at the address 0xbfffea58 is the value 6, which is really just a random value, since the local variable name is uninitialized.\n\nTo confirm these statements, we observe the stack after the strcpy function returns.\n\n\n\nFigure 20:State of CPU registers, stack and relevant memory addresses after the strcpy command\n\nWe can see from the above screen shot that the passed argument temp2, at stack memory location 0xbfffea54, has been copied to stack location 0xbfffea50. These correspond to ESP + 4 and ESP respectively.\n\nWe also observe that the function strcpy returns a pointer to a character (i.e. a string), and by convention, this pointer is returned into the register EAX. From the Linux man page for strcpy:char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);\n\nWe can observe from the above screenshot that the returned value into EAX is: 0xbfffea58, which is the memory address of the local variable name on the stack. This is the memory address of the buffer we need to overflow.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#discovering-the-memory-address-of-the-buffer-we-wish-to-overflow","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Calculating how many bytes we need to inject into the vulnerable buffer to overwrite the instruction pointer EIP.","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#calculating-how-many-bytes-we-need-to-inject-into-the-vulnerable-buffer-to-overwrite-the-instruction-pointer-eip","position":32},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Calculating how many bytes we need to inject into the vulnerable buffer to overwrite the instruction pointer EIP.","lvl2":"Breaking Down the Attack String in Detail"},"content":"So how many attack string bytes do we need to put onto the stack?

However, the address of the top of the stack is different. For GEF it is 0xbfffebec, and for PEDA it is 0xbfffec0c. This discrepancy was caused by the executable meet being started as two different processes, each with its own address space. One process was started for GEF, and another one for PEDA.\n\nTherefore we should not be surprised that the top of the stack is different on each invocation of an executable, even with address randomization turned on. To make the calculation, we simply subtract the address of the top of the stack from the address of the buffer. In both cases, we obtain the following calculations:\n\nGDB UI Name\n\nMemory Address of Buffer\n\nMemory Address of Top of Stack\n\nDifference in Hex [bytes]\n\nDifference in Decimal [bytes]\n\nGEF\n\n0xbfffef3a\n\n0xbfffebec\n\n0x34e\n\n846\n\nPEDA\n\n0xbfffef3a\n\n0xbfffec0c\n\n0x32e\n\n814\n\nThe difference in bytes is the number of bytes that we need to inject into the vulnerable buffer to overwrite the saved EIP.\n\nStated mathematically, we have:GEF 0xbfffef3a - 0xbfffebec = 0x34e bytes = 846 bytes  \n   \nPEDA 0xbfffef3a - 0xbfffec0c = 0x32e bytes = 814 bytes\n\nThe astute reader will notice that we calculated the theoretical number of bytes needed to overwrite the saved EIP was 812 bytes. However, in both cases, GEF and PEDA, we have more than 812 bytes. The reason is that we are allowed to overwrite even through the top of the stack, as long as the saved EIP is overwritten with the address of the overflowed buffer, and this address is aligned correctly to 4 bytes. If it is misaligned, then instead of reading 0xbfffef3a from the top of the stack, the CPU might read a shifted version of this. If this happens, the CPU will jump to this shifted version of the address that we want, and will most likely halt on a segmentation fault.\n\nIn order to verify that the attack string arranges its return addresses correctly aligned to 4 bytes, we could do a number of things. Within GDB, we could simply issue the following command:x/300x $esp+812\n\nThis command will show us the contents of the stack memory starting at ESP and going down by 812 bytes. This will show us the entire attack string in stack memory, with some margin. We will now demonstrate this in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nFigure 23:Examining stack memory 812 bytes below ESP\n\nReferring to the screenshot above, we wanted to observe the contents of stack memory starting at ESP and going down by 812 bytes. Notice that since the stack grows downward, we need to do the opposite operation, and add 812 bytes, rather than subtract. To look at a byte, we need two hexadecimal digits; therefore, looking at 300 hexadecimal digits will show us 900 bytes. This will enable us to see our entire attack string in stack memory, with some margin. To accomplish this, we enter the following command:\n\nNotice from the above screenshot that there is a NULL byte just ahead of our NOP sled. Since we are aiming for the middle of the NOP sled, this leading NULL bytes is of little consquence. Now that we have discovered the address of the vulnerable buffer, and figured out how many bytes we need to inject into it for a successful buffer overflow, we will now look at how to discover the stack address from the command line.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#state-of-execution-just-before-the-saved-eip-is-popped-off-of-the-stack-and-execution-is-supposed-to-return-back-to-the-main-function-in-the-executable-meet-according-to-the-peda-ui-for-gdb","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl2":"Discovering the memory address of the stack"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#discovering-the-memory-address-of-the-stack","position":38},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl2":"Discovering the memory address of the stack"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#discovering-the-memory-address-of-the-stack","position":39},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Variations in the top of the stack with multiple attack attempts from the command line","lvl2":"Discovering the memory address of the stack"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#variations-in-the-top-of-the-stack-with-multiple-attack-attempts-from-the-command-line","position":40},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"Variations in the top of the stack with multiple attack attempts from the command line","lvl2":"Discovering the memory address of the stack"},"content":"Before we can figure out the return address to place onto the stack so that we can successfuly overwrite the saved EIP, we need to know the current address of the stack. This is a little bit tricky, because every time the attack is attempted, the stack address changes a little bit, even with ASLR turned off. The reason is that Linux tries to reclaim memory after the failed attack completes, and other processes are always executing at the same time, so the stack address tends to shift around a bit, by about 500 to 1000 bytes.\n\nWhile this is not a large range, it is enough to render the attack string useless, as it will probably crash with a segmentation fault, or the attack will simply be ignored. This all depends on which way the top of the stack has shifted in memory. However, command line attacks are still possible as the stack will most likely stay at the same location for a few attempted attacks.\n\nIn the next section, we will demonstrate a small C program that can print out the current memory address of the stack.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#variations-in-the-top-of-the-stack-with-multiple-attack-attempts-from-the-command-line","position":41},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"A small program that displays the current state of the stack pointer","lvl2":"Discovering the memory address of the stack"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/basic-linux-exploits/basic-linux-exploits#a-small-program-that-displays-the-current-state-of-the-stack-pointer","position":42},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Basic Linux Exploits","lvl3":"A small program that displays the current state of the stack pointer","lvl2":"Discovering the memory address of the stack"},"content":"To discover the address of the stack segment in memory, we use the program listed below:#include <stdio.h>\n\nunsigned int get_sp(void)\n{\n    __asm__(\"movl %esp, %eax\");\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    printf(\"Stack pointer (ESP): 0x%x\\n\", get_sp());\n}\n\nThe program uses inline assembly within C. By convention, a the return value of a C function returns is contained within EAX. By calling the function get_sp, the ESP register is copied to EAX and returned to the printf statement. In this way, we obtain what is contained within ESP, the top of the stack.\n\nThis returned value is printed out as a memory address via the 0x%x format string. The screenshot below will display the output of running this program a few times.\n\n\n\nFigure 24:Running get_sp many times to obtain the same memory address of the stack\n\nNow that we have the address of the stack, or ESP, we can now make the calculation to figure out the return address that we want to append to the end of our attack string.

The program creates three integers: a, b, and c. a is assigned the value of 1, b is assigned the value of 9, and c is assigned the result of the operation a + b.\n\nThe program is obviously very simple, with no inputs and outputs.

The program creates three integers: a, b, and c. a is assigned the value of 10, b is assigned the value of 2, and c is assigned the result of the operation a / b.\n\nThe program is obviously very simple, with no inputs and outputs. The idea is to generate the binary and look at the disassembly to learn about the workings of the 64-bit ARM processor platform.\n\nThe chosen test system is my trusty Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, which has a 64-bit ARMv8 processor. This is a very convenient platform for this exercise due to its availability and ease of access from multiple remote systems via SSH.\n\nThe program is compiled with the GNU Fortran compiler, gfortran, which is available on the ARM platform. The program is compiled with debugging information using the -ggdb3 option, which allows us to debug the program in GDB and see the source code interspersed with the assembly instructions.\n\nThe program is compiled with:$ gfortran -ggdb3 div_int.f08 -o div_int_Fortran_aarch64_ggdb3\n\nFor general edification, we also have gfortran produce generic assembly with the -S option, an object file with the -o option, and object dumps of the object and executable files.\n\nThe generic assembly is generated by using the -S (assembly) option:$ gfortran -S -ggdb3 div_int.f08 -o div_int.s\n\nThe object file is generated by using the -c (compile) option:$ gfortran -c -ggdb3 div_int.s -o div_int.o\n\nThe objdump files are generated by using the following command and options:$ objdump -x -D -S -s -g -t div_int.o > objdump_of_dot_o.txt\n$ objdump -x -D -S -s -g -t div_int_Fortran_aarch64_ggdb3 > objdump_of_dot_exe.txt\n\nA rundown of the objdump options is shown here:$objdump \nUsage: objdump <option(s)> <file(s)>\n Display information from object <file(s)>.\n At least one of the following switches must be given:\n  -a, --archive-headers    Display archive header information\n  -f, --file-headers       Display the contents of the overall file header\n  -p, --private-headers    Display object format specific file header contents\n  -P, --private=OPT,OPT...

The Fortran source, embedded in the disassembly, is a program named “div_int” that declares three integers (a, b, c), assigns a = 10 and b = 5, computes c = a / b (integer division, resulting in 2), and ends without any output or I/O. It’s essentially a trivial computation with no side effects.\n\nThe code is split into two functions:\n\n<MAIN__>: The mangled name for the Fortran main program body. It handles variable allocation, assignments, the division, and cleanup.\n\n<main>: The actual entry point, generated by the compiler for runtime setup. It interfaces with the GNU Fortran runtime library (libgfortran) to handle command-line arguments and options, calls <MAIN__>, and exits.\n\nThe code uses stack storage for variables (no register optimization, suggesting unoptimized compilation like -O0). Instructions include hexadecimal offsets, opcodes, mnemonics, and operands. Some calls use the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) for dynamic linking to external functions (e.g., from libgfortran). Relocations or PLT stubs (like @plt) indicate linker-resolved addresses.\n\nAArch64 conventions: 64-bit registers (x0-x31), 32-bit views (w0-w31), stack pointer (sp) grows downward, little-endian memory.

The program creates three integers: a, b, and c. a is assigned the value of 10, b is assigned the value of 4, and c is assigned the result of the operation MOD(a, b).  MOD() is a Fortran intrinsic function that returns the remainder of the division of a by b.\n\nThe program is obviously very simple, with no inputs and outputs. The idea is to generate the binary and look at the disassembly to learn about the workings of the 64-bit ARM processor platform.\n\nThe chosen test system is my trusty Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, which has a 64-bit ARMv8 processor. This is a very convenient platform for this exercise due to its availability and ease of access from multiple remote systems via SSH.\n\nThe program is compiled with the GNU Fortran compiler, gfortran, which is available on the ARM platform. The program is compiled with debugging information using the -ggdb3 option, which allows us to debug the program in GDB and see the source code interspersed with the assembly instructions.\n\nThe program is compiled with:$ gfortran -ggdb3 mod_int.f08 -o mod_int_Fortran_aarch64_ggdb3\n\nFor general edification, we also have gfortran produce generic assembly with the -S option, an object file with the -o option, and object dumps of the object and executable files.\n\nThe generic assembly is generated by using the -S (assembly) option:$ gfortran -S -ggdb3 mod_int.f08 -o mod_int.s\n\nThe object file is generated by using the -c (compile) option:$ gfortran -c -ggdb3 mod_int.s -o mod_int.o\n\nThe objdump files are generated by using the following command and options:$ objdump -x -D -S -s -g -t mod_int.o > objdump_of_dot_o.txt\n$ objdump -x -D -S -s -g -t mod_int_Fortran_aarch64_ggdb3 > objdump_of_dot_exe.txt\n\nA rundown of the objdump options is shown here:$objdump \nUsage: objdump <option(s)> <file(s)>\n Display information from object <file(s)>.\n At least one of the following switches must be given:\n  -a, --archive-headers    Display archive header information\n  -f, --file-headers       Display the contents of the overall file header\n  -p, --private-headers    Display object format specific file header contents\n  -P, --private=OPT,OPT...

The Fortran source is provided inline for context:program mod_int\n    implicit none\n    integer :: a, b, c\n    a = 10\n    b = 4\n    c = MOD(a, b)\nend program mod_int\n\nThis program declares three 32-bit integers (a, b, c), assigns a = 10 and b = 4, and computes c = MOD(10, 4), which should yield 2 (the remainder of 10 divided by 4). The result is stored but not used further (e.g., no printing or return value), so the program has no visible side effects when run—it simply computes and exits.\n\nThe disassembly consists of two main functions:\n\nMAIN__ at address 0x814: This is the compiler-generated name for the Fortran program’s body (common in gfortran). It allocates stack space for the three integers, performs the assignments and modulo operation, and returns.\n\nmain at address 0x850: The C-style entry point for the executable, which handles command-line arguments, initializes the GNU Fortran (gfortran) runtime library, calls MAIN__, and exits with status 0.\n\nThis code was likely compiled with gfortran (evident from calls to _gfortran_set_args and _gfortran_set_options). It’s unoptimized, as seen in redundant loads (e.g., reloading b after division). The program uses 32-bit operations (w registers) for integers, matching Fortran’s default INTEGER type.\n\nA key focus is the MOD(a, b) operation, which requires multiple instructions because ARM64 lacks a direct signed modulo instruction. Instead, the compiler implements it using signed division (sdiv), multiplication (mul), and subtraction (sub). This is a standard software emulation of modulo: a % b = a - ((a / b) * b), where / is integer division. This approach ensures correct handling of signed integers (e.g., negative values, though not used here), but it’s less efficient than a hypothetical hardware modulo. ARM64 does have unsigned divide-with-remainder (udiv + msub for multiply-subtract), but for signed operations like Fortran’s MOD, the compiler opts for this sequence to handle signs properly (using sdiv for signed division). If optimization were enabled (e.g., -O2), the compiler might inline constants or reduce redundancies, but here it’s straightforward.\n\nI’ll explain each instruction in detail, including opcode, semantics, context, and binary encoding. ARM64 conventions: Registers x0-x30 (64-bit), w0-w30 (lower 32 bits); stack grows downward; ABI uses x0-x7 for params, x0 for returns, x29 for frame pointer, x30 for link register.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/mod-int/mod-int#overview-of-the-disassembly","position":53},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Modulo Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of MAIN__ (Fortran Program Logic)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/mod-int/mod-int#detailed-explanation-of-main-fortran-program-logic","position":54},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Modulo Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of MAIN__ (Fortran Program Logic)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"content":"This function allocates 16 bytes on the stack (for three 4-byte integers, padded for 16-byte alignment), assigns values to a and b, computes c = MOD(a, b) via the multi-step sequence, and cleans up.

Result written back to sp. ARM64 requires manual stack management; allocations must be 16-byte aligned.Context: Function prologue. Reserves space for a at sp+12 (4 bytes), b at sp+8, c at sp+4, with padding at sp+0 for alignment. After this, sp points to the frame base.\n\n818: 52800140 mov w0, #0xaBinary: 52 80 01 40Semantics: Moves immediate 0xa (10 decimal) into w0 (lower 32 bits of x0; upper bits zeroed).

No remainder is produced directly.Context: First step of modulo: Compute quotient q = a / b (stored in w2). This is necessary because ARM64 has no single-instruction signed modulo. sdiv is used over udiv (unsigned) to match Fortran’s signed integer behavior.\n\n834: b9400be1 ldr w1, [sp, #8]Binary: b9 40 0b e1Semantics: Reloads b (4) from sp + 8 into w1.Context: Prepares b for multiplication.

This reconstructs the largest multiple of b less than or equal to a (for positive values).\n\n83c: 4b010000 sub w0, w0, w1Binary: 4b 01 00 00Semantics: Subtracts w0 = w0 - w1 (10 - 8 = 2). Integer subtraction without borrow flags checked.Context: Final step of modulo: Remainder r = a - (q * b). This yields the modulo result (2). The multi-step process is needed because:\n\nARM64’s integer division instructions (sdiv, udiv) only produce the quotient, not the remainder.\n\nFor signed modulo, the compiler must ensure the remainder has the sign of the dividend (Fortran MOD rule: remainder same sign as a), which sdiv + mul + sub achieves.\n\nHardware support for remainder exists in some forms (e.g., msub for multiply-subtract in unsigned contexts), but for signed ops, this sequence is portable and safe.\n\nAlternatives like bit manipulation or loops aren’t efficient for general cases. If b were a power of 2, the compiler might optimize to AND (e.g., MOD(a, 4) = a & 3), but here b=4 is constant—unoptimized code doesn’t exploit that.\n\nEdge cases (e.g., b=0 causes divide-by-zero trap in sdiv; negative a or b) are handled implicitly by sdiv’s signed semantics.\n\n840: b90007e0 str w0, [sp, #4]Binary: b9 00 07 e0Semantics: Stores w0 (2) at sp + 4.Context: Assigns result to c.

The program creates three integers: a, b, and c. a is assigned the value of 2, b is assigned the value of 3, and c is assigned the result of the operation a * b.\n\nThe program is obviously very simple, with no inputs and outputs. The idea is to generate the binary and look at the disassembly to learn about the workings of the 64-bit ARM processor platform.\n\nThe chosen test system is my trusty Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, which has a 64-bit ARMv8 processor.

The Fortran source code, as annotated in the disassembly, is a basic program that declares three integers (a, b, c), assigns values to a and b, computes their product, and stores it in c. It doesn’t output anything or perform I/O, so it’s essentially a no-op beyond the computation.\n\nThe disassembly is divided into two main functions:\n\n<MAIN__>: This is the compiled body of the Fortran program mult. Fortran compilers often mangle the main program name to MAIN__ (in uppercase with underscores) to distinguish it from other subroutines.\n\n<main>: This is the actual program entry point, written in a C-like style. It’s generated by the compiler to handle runtime initialization for Fortran (e.g., setting up command-line arguments and options via the GNU Fortran runtime library, libgfortran). It calls <MAIN__> and then exits cleanly.\n\nThe code uses stack-based storage for variables (common in optimized compilations without register allocation for such simple locals). Instructions are in hexadecimal offsets, followed by the opcode, mnemonic, and operands. Some instructions have relocations (e.g., R_AARCH64_CALL26), which are linker directives for resolving addresses at link time (e.g., calling external functions).\n\nI’ll explain each section in detail, breaking down every instruction, its purpose, and how it relates to the Fortran source. Note that AArch64 uses 64-bit registers (x0-x31 for general-purpose, w0-w31 for 32-bit views), stack pointer (sp), and program counter (pc).

It allocates stack space for the three integers (a, b, c), assigns values, performs the multiplication, and then deallocates the stack before returning. Since Fortran integers are typically 32-bit (4 bytes), each variable takes 4 bytes on the stack.\n\n0: d10043ff  sub sp, sp, #0x10Subtract 0x10 (16 in decimal) from the stack pointer (sp). This allocates 16 bytes of stack space: 4 bytes each for a, b, c (12 bytes total), plus 4 bytes of padding to maintain 16-byte stack alignment (AArch64 ABI requirement). The stack grows downward, so subtracting from sp creates space. This corresponds to entering the program mult and preparing for variable declarations.\n\n4: 52800040  mov w0, #0x2Move the immediate value 0x2 (2 in decimal) into the 32-bit register w0. This sets up the value for a = 2. w0 is a temporary register here.\n\n8: b9000fe0  str w0, [sp, #12]Store the value from w0 (2) into memory at [sp + 12]. This assigns to a, which is at offset 12 from the current sp (top of the allocated stack space).\n\nc: 52800060  mov w0, #0x3Move 0x3 (3) into w0. This prepares b = 3.\n\n10: b9000be0  str w0, [sp, #8]Store w0 (3) into [sp + 8]. This assigns to b (next stack slot below a).\n\n14: b9400fe1  ldr w1, [sp, #12]Load the value from [sp + 12] ( a = 2) into w1. This loads the first operand for the multiplication c = a * b.\n\n18: b9400be0  ldr w0, [sp, #8]Load [sp + 8] ( b = 3) into w0. Now w0 holds b, w1 holds a.\n\n1c: 1b007c20  mul w0, w1, w0Multiply w1 ( a ) by w0 ( b ), storing the result in w0. This computes 2 * 3 = 6, corresponding to c = a * b. The mul instruction handles signed/unsigned multiplication (integers are signed in Fortran, but for positive values it doesn’t matter).\n\n20: b90007e0  str w0, [sp, #4]Store the result from w0 (6) into [sp + 4]. This assigns to c (next stack slot).\n\n24: d503201f  nopNo operation. This is a padding instruction, often inserted by compilers for alignment or to avoid hazards. It marks the end of the computation before cleanup, corresponding to end program mult.\n\n28: 910043ff  add sp, sp, #0x10Add 0x10 back to sp, deallocating the stack space. This cleans up after the variables.\n\n2c: d65f03c0  retReturn from the function by jumping to the address in x30 (link register, set by the caller). This exits <MAIN__>.\n\nIn summary, <MAIN__> is a straightforward translation: allocate stack, assign constants to a and b, load them, multiply, store to c, deallocate, and return. No optimizations like register allocation for variables are applied here (possibly due to debug mode or simple code), so everything uses stack memory.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/mult-int/mult-int#detailed-explanation-of-main-offset-0x0000000000000000","position":45},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Multiply Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of <main> (Offset 0x0000000000000030)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/mult-int/mult-int#detailed-explanation-of-main-offset-0x0000000000000030","position":46},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Multiply Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of <main> (Offset 0x0000000000000030)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"content":"This is the program’s true entry point, generated to bridge C-style startup (e.g., from the OS or loader) to Fortran.

The program creates three integers: a, b, and c. a is assigned the value of 5, b is assigned the value of 3, and c is assigned the result of the operation a - b.\n\nThe program is obviously very simple, with no inputs and outputs. The idea is to generate the binary and look at the disassembly to learn about the workings of the 64-bit ARM processor platform.\n\nThe chosen test system is my trusty Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, which has a 64-bit ARMv8 processor. This is a very convenient platform for this exercise due to its availability and ease of access from multiple remote systems via SSH.\n\nThe program is compiled with the GNU Fortran compiler, gfortran, which is available on the ARM platform.

It appears to be the machine code output from a compiled Fortran program, as indicated by the function names (MAIN__ is a common Fortran compiler-generated name for the user-defined main body) and calls to GNU Fortran (gfortran) runtime functions like _gfortran_set_args and _gfortran_set_options. These are part of the Fortran runtime library, suggesting this binary was compiled from a simple Fortran source code.\n\nThe disassembly has two main parts:\n\n**MAIN__ at address 0x0000000000000000 (likely the Fortran program’s core logic): A subroutine that allocates stack space, initializes two integer variables to 5 and 3, subtracts their difference (5 - 3 = 2), stores the result, and returns without further action (e.g., no output or side effects visible here).\n\n**main at address 0x0000000000000000 (the C-style entry point): The program’s entry point, which sets up the stack, passes command-line arguments to the Fortran runtime, configures runtime options, calls MAIN__, and exits cleanly with status 0.\n\nThis code does not perform any input/output or complex operations—it’s essentially a “hello world”-level computation that computes but discards a result. In a real Fortran context, it might be a minimal example or part of a larger program where the result could be used elsewhere, but here it’s standalone and returns without printing.\n\nI’ll explain each instruction in detail, including:\n\nOpcode and operands: What the instruction is.\n\nSemantics: What it does to registers, memory, or control flow.\n\nContext: How it fits into the function and overall program.\n\nBinary encoding: The hex bytes (as given) for reference.\n\nI’ll group related instructions for clarity and note ARM64 conventions:\n\nRegisters: x0-x30 are 64-bit general-purpose; w variants (e.g., w0`) access the lower 32 bits (for ints).\n\nStack: Grows downward; sp is the stack pointer.\n\nCalling convention: AArch64 ABI: Parameters in x0-x7, return in x0, frame pointer in x29, link register in x30.\n\nImmediates: #0x5 means literal value 5.\n\nAddresses are absolute but may be rebased in the binary.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/sub-int/sub-int#overview-of-the-disassembly","position":49},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Subtract Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of MAIN__ (Fortran Program Logic)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/sub-int/sub-int#detailed-explanation-of-main-fortran-program-logic","position":50},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Subtract Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of MAIN__ (Fortran Program Logic)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"content":"This function allocates 16 bytes on the stack for local variables (likely three 4-byte integers), performs a subtraction, and cleans up.

Computes 2, but does nothing with it\n\nThe nop is likely compiler-inserted for alignment or optimization.\n\n**814: d10043ff sub sp, sp, #0x10Binary: d1 00 43 ffSemantics: Subtracts the immediate value 0x10 (16 in decimal) from the stack pointer (sp), effectively allocating 16 bytes of stack space for local storage. The result is written back to sp. In ARM64, stack allocation is manual; this creates a small frame for variables (sp+4, sp+8, sp+12) and possibly alignment (stacks must be 16-byte aligned).Context: Standard function prologue. The 16-byte size is minimal; 12 bytes for three 32-bit ints, padded to 16 for alignment. After this, sp points to the new stack frame base.\n\n818: 52 80 00 a0 mov w0, #0x5Binary: 52 80 00 a0 (encoded as 528000a0 in some notations, but as given).Semantics: Moves the immediate value 5 (0x5) into the lower 32 bits of register x0 (denoted as w0 for 32-bit view). The upper 32 bits of x0 are implicitly zeroed. This is a “move immediate” instruction.Context: Initializes a temporary register with the constant 5, which will be stored as the first variable (var1 in my Fortran example).\n\n81c: b9000fe0 str w0, [sp, #12]Binary: Stores the 32-bit value in w0 (5) into memory at address sp + 12. str is “store register”.Semantics: Writes to the stack location reserved for the first variable. Stack offsets are relative to current sp.Context: Saves the value 5 to a local variable (e.g., var1 = 5).\n\n820: 52800060 mov w0, #0x3Binary: 52000000000060, but given as 52800060.Semantics: Moves immediate 3 into w0, overwriting the previous value (5).Context: Initializes temporary for the second variable (var2 = 3).\n\n824: b9000be0 str w0, [sp, #8]Semantics: Stores w0 (3) at sp + 8.Context: Saves the value 3 to the second stack location (e.g., var2).\n\n828: b9400fe1 ldr w1, [sp, #12]Binary: b9 40 0f e1Semantics: Loads the 32-bit value from memory at sp + 12 (which is 5) into w1. ldr is “load register”.Context: Retrieves var1 into w1 for the upcoming subtraction (left operand).\n\n82c: b9400be0 ldr w0, [sp, #8]Semantics: Loads from sp + 8 (3) into w0 (right operand).Context: Prepares the subtrahend.\n\n830: 4b000020 sub w0, w1, w0**Binary: 4b 00 00 20  **Semantics**: Subtractsw0(3) fromw1(5), storing the result (2) inw0. This is integer subtraction without carry (no overflow check visible).   **Context**: The core operation: result = var1 - var2. In Fortran, integers are typically 32-bit, matching w` registers.\n\n834: b90007e0 str w0, [sp, #4]Semantics: Stores w0 (2) at sp + 4.Context: Saves the result to the third stack location (e.g., result). Note: The result is stored but never used or returned—typical of a computation without side effects.\n\n838: d503201f nopBinary: d5 03 20 1fSemantics: No operation—does nothing, just a placeholder that advances the program counter. Often inserted by compilers for instruction alignment (ARM64 prefers 4-byte alignment) or to pad for timing/branch targets.Context: Likely compiler-generated; no functional purpose here. In some cases, it’s for debugging or to avoid hazards, but unnecessary in this simple sequence.\n\n83c: 910043ff add sp, sp, #0x10Semantics: Adds 0x10 (16) back to sp, deallocating the stack frame and restoring the caller’s stack.Context: Function epilogue—cleans up locals before returning.\n\n840: d65f03c0 retSemantics: Returns to the caller by jumping to the address in the link register x30 (set by the caller via bl). No return value is set, so it implicitly returns whatever is in x0 (undefined here, but Fortran subroutines don’t return values like this).Context: Ends MAIN__.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/sub-int/sub-int#detailed-explanation-of-main-fortran-program-logic","position":51},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Subtract Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of main (Program Entry Point)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/disassembling-binaries/fortran/arm64/sub-int/sub-int#detailed-explanation-of-main-program-entry-point","position":52},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Fortran - ARM 64-Bit Platform - Subtract Two Integers","lvl3":"Detailed Explanation of main (Program Entry Point)","lvl2":"Explaining the Disassembly by Grok 4"},"content":"This is the standard wrapper for Fortran programs compiled with gfortran.

Sets x30 to return address. This calls the Fortran runtime to process command-line args for Fortran use.Context: Initializes Fortran’s argument handling. PLT is Procedure Linkage Table for dynamic linking.\n\n860: 90000000 adrp x0, 0Semantics: “Address relative to page”: Loads the base address of the current 4GB page (0 here, likely the data section) into x0. adrp for page-aligned.Context: Prepares a base address for the next instruction to compute an address.\n\n864: 91248001 add x1, x0, #0x920Semantics: Adds offset 0x920 (2336 decimal) to x0, storing in x1.

This instruction loads the effective address of what the location at ESP+0x1C (ESP+28) contains. All this does is result in EAX containing the stack address ESP+0x1C (ESP+28). This can be verified by issuing the following command:\n\ngef➤ x/x $esp+0x1c0xffffd11c: 0xf7f9c808gef➤\n\nWe can see that the address 0xffffd11c was loaded into eax from the operation lea eax, [esp+0x1c]. What is so special about the address ESP+0x1C (ESP+28)? Our stack pointer is at 0xffffd100. Adding 0x1C to this address results in 0xffffd11c. The difference is 28 bytes. If you recall, previously the stack pointer was moved down by 96 bytes. Then at ESP+92 bytes, the local variable modified was stored on the stack. This leaves 92 bytes left for the local buffer buffer[64]. What this means is that buffer[64] is at ESP+0x1C, or at stack address 0xffffd11c.\n\nThe compiler decided to place buffer[64] at ESP+28 bytes. The difference is:\n\n92-28 = 64 bytes exactly.\n\nThe question then becomes, why did the compiler allocate the extra:\n\n96 - (64 + 4) = 28 bytes?\n\nTo find out, we now advance another step and examine the effect on the stack.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#id-0x8048405-lea-eax-esp-0x1c","position":57},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl3":"Disassembling and Executing The Vulnerable C Program stack0.c with GDB+GEF","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#disassembling-and-executing-the-vulnerable-c-program-stack0-c-with-gdb-gef-6","position":58},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl3":"Disassembling and Executing The Vulnerable C Program stack0.c with GDB+GEF","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#disassembling-and-executing-the-vulnerable-c-program-stack0-c-with-gdb-gef-6","position":59},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl4":"Stepping From (main+21) to (main+24)","lvl3":"Disassembling and Executing The Vulnerable C Program stack0.c with GDB+GEF","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#stepping-from-main-21-to-main-24","position":60},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl4":"Stepping From (main+21) to (main+24)","lvl3":"Disassembling and Executing The Vulnerable C Program stack0.c with GDB+GEF","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#stepping-from-main-21-to-main-24","position":61},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl4":"0x8048409 mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax","lvl3":"Disassembling and Executing The Vulnerable C Program stack0.c with GDB+GEF","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#id-0x8048409-mov-dword-ptr-esp-eax","position":62},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl4":"0x8048409 mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax","lvl3":"Disassembling and Executing The Vulnerable C Program stack0.c with GDB+GEF","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"content":"In this section, we advance a single assembly instruction, describe what happened, and show the state of the stack.\n\nExecution was advanced a single step in GDB+GEF by using the si instruction. EIP now points to (main+24).\n\n\n\nFigure 10:State of execution after mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax\n\nThis instruction effectively “pushes” the contents of EAX onto the stack. Why has the compiler decided to use this instruction rather than a push EAX? This is a good question, and may be a function of optimization or byte alignment.\n\nAs can be seen from the disassembly above, the instruction mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax was executed. This instruction loads what is stored in EAX into the the address at the location that ESP points to. In other words, the top of the stack. Effectively, the contents of EAX, or the address 0xffffd11c, was pushed onto the stack. The memory address 0xffffd11c contains the value 0xf7f9c808, which by itself is also a memory address. So what is stored at ESP is basically a pointer to a memory address, or equivalently a pointer to a string.\n\nWhat was the purpose of all of this setup? It might have something to do with the next assembly instruction, which is a call to the gets function. Let’s look at the man page for the gets function for some answers...\n\nGETS(3)                   Linux Programmer’s Manual                  GETS(3)\n\nNAMEgets - get a string from standard input (DEPRECATED)\n\nSYNOPSIS**#include <stdio.h>**\n**char \\*gets(char \\***_s_**);**\n\nDESCRIPTION_Never use this function_.\n\n**gets**() reads a line from _stdin_ into the buffer pointed to by _s_ until\neither a terminating newline or **EOF**, which it replaces with a null\nbyte ('\\\\0').  No check for buffer overrun is performed (see BUGS\nbelow).\n\nRETURN VALUE**gets**() returns _s_ on success, and NULL on error or when end of file\noccurs while no characters have been read.  However, given the lack\nof buffer overrun checking, there can be no guarantees that the\nfunction will even return.\n\nSo we can see from the man page for the function gets that it takes in a string (i.e. an address), and on success returns a string (i.e. an address) into EAX. We know that in x86-32Bit Linux, the arguments to a function are pushed in reverse order onto the stack. Since there is only one argument, this argument was loaded onto the top of the stack. That was the reason why we had the instruction mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax. The contents of what is stored at the address ESP is the argument to the gets function.\n\nWhat is the significance of the address 0xffffd11c? Well, this is actually a stack address! If this address sounds familiar it is. 0xffffd11c, as we have found out earlier, is the address of the local variable buffer[64]. So basically, the gets function was given the address of the local variable buffer[64], and any data entered into stdin will be stored on the stack, starting at address 0xffffd11c.\n\nThis is a tremendous clue as to how to complete this challenge. If the number of entered bytes into stdin is less than the size of the buffer, then everything is fine according to the local variable modified. It was set to zero and will remain zero. The program will continue and exit as usual. Although the program is fine, the challenge was not accomplished.\n\nIf one were to enter more than 64 bytes into stdin, then since the gets function has no bounds checking, it will overflow buffer[64] and overwrite the local variable modified. Let’s draw the current state of the stack to provide a visual explanation.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#id-0x8048409-mov-dword-ptr-esp-eax","position":63},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl3":"Layout of the stack in program stack0.c after mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax instruction.","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/protostar/stack0/stack0-x86/stack0-x86#layout-of-the-stack-in-program-stack0-c-after-mov-dword-ptr-esp-eax-instruction","position":64},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"x86 32-Bit","lvl3":"Layout of the stack in program stack0.c after mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax instruction.","lvl2":"Introduction - First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable"},"content":"The table below illustrates the layout of the stack once mov DWORD PTR [esp], eax is executed.\n\nStack Address - High Memory\n\nStack Entry Name\n\nValue\n\nSize [bytes]\n\n0xffffd174\n\nARGV (Address of array of strings.

As expected, this string was put into the local variable buffer[64], and the address of this string was also returned into EAX.\n\nWe can confirm that the string “AAAA” was entered onto the stack by looking at the stack memory address 0xffffd11c in the image above. It contains four “A”'s directly. This same stack address was also entered into EAX.\n\nObviously, four “A”'s is less than 64 bytes, where each “A” uses up one byte. Therefore, we can conclude that the local variable modified has not been altered.

It then does a string compare of the variable p with the first argument passed to the executable from the command line. If the first argument is the same string as p, the strcmp function returns a zero. The enveloping if statement checks for this condition and if true, executes the statement:printf(\"\\nWelcome to the SLAE 64-bit course! Please proceed to the next video!\\n\");\n\nOne way to crack this simple password checking routine is to run this program in GDB and trick the program into thinking that any randomly entered command line argument is the password. This is done by setting the register that contains the randomly entered password to the hardcoded password “PentesterAcademyPass” from within GDB. The executable then continues running thinking that the correct password was entered.\n\nWe will now demonstrate the entire process.\n\nTo do this, we need to first compile the program into an executable.

The idea is that the strcmp function returns a zero into eax if the command line argument to the gdb_test executable matches the hardcoded password. If the strings match, then the test eax, eax instruction performs a bitwise AND on the operands and sets the zero flag if the strings matched. The result of the bitwise AND is not stored back into the register eax, only the zero flag is set.\n\nAfter the test eax, eax instruction, we see a jne or a Jump if Not Equal instruction, and then a series of puts function calls. If the zero flag is not set, the program jumps to main+70, prints a string and then exits. If they are equal, the puts function call at main+63 executes and then jumps to main+82 near the end of the program.\n\nWe can see a graphical visualization of this with the help of Radare2.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/slae64/modules/module-1/section-3-gdb-test/section-3-gdb-test#highlighting-the-strcmp-instruction-for-clarity","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lesson 3 - GDB Test","lvl2":"Disassembly of the Function main in Radare2"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/slae64/modules/module-1/section-3-gdb-test/section-3-gdb-test#disassembly-of-the-function-main-in-radare2","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lesson 3 - GDB Test","lvl2":"Disassembly of the Function main in Radare2"},"content":"In the screenshot below, we disassemble the function main in Radare2\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the function main in Radare2\n\nIn the screenshot above, we can see the disassembly of the function main in Radare2.\n\nIn Radare2, we can clearly see the flow graph of the branching after the test for zero in eax is performed.

This has been highlighted for clarity. The program will then execute a number of instructions that set up the stack for the local variables. We will not go into the details here in this section, because here will concentrate on using GDB to crack the program.\n\nWhat is important to note is that the arguments to the vulnerable strcmp function are passed through the registers RDI and RSI. We will now set a breakpoint just before test eax, eax and also highlight RDI and RSI for clarity.\n\n\n\nSetting a Breakpoint Before test eax, eax\n\nIn the screenshot above, we can see that a breakpoint was set at *main+52, which corresponds to the test eax, eax instruction. We can also see that the two lines prior to the strcmp call were highlighted, to emphasize that the arguments to strcmp are passed via the registers RDI and RSI, per calling convention.\n\nWe will now continue execution until the breakpoint at *main+52.\n\n\n\nBefore strcmp Showing RDI and RSI Registers\n\nIn the screenshot above, we can see that the breakpoint at *main+52 was hit. The arguments to strcmp are passed via the registers RDI and RSI, per calling convention. The RDI contains the memory address of the passed command line argument “AAAA”, while RSI contains the address of the hardcoded password “PentesterAcademyPass”.\n\nThe two strings pointed to RDI and RSI are obviously different. The result of the strcmp call will place a non-zero result into rax, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\nResult of strcmp Showing RAX\n\nWe can see in the screenshot above that the result of the strcmp call results in a non-zero value being returned into the rax register. The next instructions is:\n\ntest eax, eax\n\nWhat this instruction will do is to perform a bitwise AND operation on the register eax with itself. If eax contains zero, its bitwise and is also zero. This will set the zero flag and a subsequent jump operation can be performed based on the state of this flag.\n\nWhat we want to do is to make the output of the strcmp function return a zero into the eax register, or just zero out the register eax using GDB prior to the test eax, eax instruction.\n\nWe choose to set the register rdi and rsi equal to each other using GDB. With this change, the output of the strcmp function call will return a zero into the register rax. This will effectively crack the password checking program.\n\nIn the next section, we will set the register rdi equal to rsi.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/slae64/modules/module-1/section-3-gdb-test/section-3-gdb-test#setting-up-a-break-point-at-the-instruction-test-eax-eax","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lesson 3 - GDB Test","lvl2":"Setting the Register rdi Equal to the Register rsi Using GDB"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/slae64/modules/module-1/section-3-gdb-test/section-3-gdb-test#setting-the-register-rdi-equal-to-the-register-rsi-using-gdb","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lesson 3 - GDB Test","lvl2":"Setting the Register rdi Equal to the Register rsi Using GDB"},"content":"In the screenshot below, we use the GDB command:set rdi=rsi\n\nTo set the registers rdi equal to the register rsi.\n\n\n\nSetting rdi Equal to rsi\n\nThe result of this operation is shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\nResult of Setting rdi to rsi\n\nAs we can see in the screenshot above, the register rdi has the same contents as the register rsi. When the strcmp function is executed, the result this comparison will result in a zero being returned into the register rax. Since there is a zero in rax, the test eax, eax instruction will cause the zero flag to be set. Following the test eax, eax instruction, we have the instruction:jne    0x55555555518b <main+70>\n\nThis instruction will not be taken because the status of the zero flag is not equal to zero. The program execution then continues to the puts function call that will print the string that we are after. The program then jumps to the exit stage, at which time it exits gracefully.

This memory location math gives exactly the length of the string \"Hello World to the SLAE-64 Course\". The way to obtain the memory location of the constant is to use the $ directive in the assembly code, as can be seen from the code snippet:length: equ $-hello_world\n\nThis is the last bit of setup needed before invoking the WRITE system call. The instruction 0x401014 <_start+20> mov edx, 0x22, will let the WRITE system call know that the length of the string to output to the screen is 0x22 hex bytes long. We are now ready to invoke the system call. This will occur in the next instruction as shown in the next section.","type":"content","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/slae64/modules/module-1/section-5-hello-world/section-5-hello-world#executing-step-0x401014-start-20-mov-edx-0x22","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 5 - Hello World","lvl4":"Executing the instruction 0x401019 <_start+25>: syscall","lvl3":"Running helloworld in GDB + PEDA","lvl2":"Lesson Content"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/cybersecurity/slae64/modules/module-1/section-5-hello-world/section-5-hello-world#executing-the-instruction-0x401019-start-25-syscall","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Section 5 - Hello World","lvl4":"Executing the instruction 0x401019 <_start+25>: syscall","lvl3":"Running helloworld in GDB + PEDA","lvl2":"Lesson Content"},"content":"Prior to executing the instruction 0x401019 <_start+25>: syscall, the state of the registers and stack are as shown below:\n\n\n\nFigure 13:Before running step 0x401019 <_start+25>: syscall\n\nThe syscall instruction invokes the Linux kernel to execute a system call.

The item is to be placed between far flung loads, to compensate for voltage drops due to long transmission distances between solar panel source and load in a microgrid commnity power sitauation.\n\nSince the amount of output current is 10A, we wanted to avoid high peak rectifier currents associated with a flyback converter. Therefore, a forward converter topology was chosen. The magnetics were chosen to be custom wound toroids.\n\nThe circuit was designed using a pick and simulate approach to save time intensive analysis time. Best / educated guesses were made for proper inductor values, a simulation was run, and the circuit performance was evaluated. This was also done for the frequency compensation.\n\nThe main PWM IC was required to be the TL494. This chip does not implement pulse-by-pulse current limiting control. This function was impleneted with additional circuitry to reduce the required loop compensation from a Type 3 amplifier to a Type 2 amplifier. This greatly improves transient response and simplifies the compenation circuit from three poles to two poles.\n\nAnother issue with the TL494 IC is that there is no official LTSpice 4 model available for it, although I was able to find a usable unofficial model. It required some modifications, which are described here:\nHacking the TL494 LTSpice Model\n\nThe entire simulation schematic is shown in the image below. Further dicussion on each of its parts will be made in subsequent sections.","type":"content","url":"/sections/electronics/power-electronics/power-supplies/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a#circuit-design-discussion","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Forward Converter 100V to 5V at 10A","lvl2":"Circuit Simulation Schematic"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/electronics/power-electronics/power-supplies/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a#circuit-simulation-schematic","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Forward Converter 100V to 5V at 10A","lvl2":"Circuit Simulation Schematic"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/electronics/power-electronics/power-supplies/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a#circuit-simulation-schematic","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Forward Converter 100V to 5V at 10A","lvl2":"Circuit Description and Simulation Results"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/electronics/power-electronics/power-supplies/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a#circuit-description-and-simulation-results","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Forward Converter 100V to 5V at 10A","lvl2":"Circuit Description and Simulation Results"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/electronics/power-electronics/power-supplies/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a#circuit-description-and-simulation-results","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Forward Converter 100V to 5V at 10A","lvl3":"PWM and Gate Drive","lvl2":"Circuit Description and Simulation Results"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/electronics/power-electronics/power-supplies/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a/forward-converter-100v-to-5v-10a#pwm-and-gate-drive","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Forward Converter 100V to 5V at 10A","lvl3":"PWM and Gate Drive","lvl2":"Circuit Description and Simulation Results"},"content":"\n\nThe TL494 is used at the PWM IC.

The aim is to setup a firewall and routing provisions on the Gateway/Server to satisfy the requirements mentioned above.\n\nTo setup the Project, two virtual machines were created: one for the Client, the other for the Gateway/Server.  The Client’s virtual machine network setup is shown in \n\nFigure 2: Client Network Setup below:\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Client Network Setup\n\nThe Gateway/Server’s network setup is shown in \n\nFigure 3: Gateway/Server Network Setup. We can see that the Gateway/Server’s network setup is multi – homed so that it can have a network port to both the 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.2.0 networks.  After the Virtual Machines were started, the Client’s network setup is verified by using the ifconfig Linux command.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Gateway/Server Network Setup\n\nThe output of the ifconfig Linux command is shown in \n\nFigure 4: Client’s ifconfig Output below:\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Client’s ifconfig Output\n\nAs required, the Client’s ifconfig output has an IP address of 10.0.2.4.  However, for the Gateway/Server, its network port that is connected to the 10.0.2.0 network has an IP address of 10.0.2.6.  Pings from the client to the Gateway server over the 10.0.2.0 network operate as normal.  In order for the Client to be able to have access to the 10.0.1.0 network visible at the Gateway/Server’s other network port, a default gateway routing entry had to be added to the Client’s routing table.  This informs the the Client’s operating system of how to handle packets whose IP addresses are not on the local network.  The Client’s routing table is shown in \n\nFigure 5: Client’s Routing Table below:\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Client’s Routing Table\n\nIn \n\nFigure 5: Client’s Routing Table, we can see a entry for the default gateway whose IP address is 10.0.2.6.  The destination address for the default gateway routing table entry is 0.0.0.0, which means that any packet whose destination IP address is not on the local network (10.0.1.0) should be sent to the Gateway/Server.\n\nThe Gateway/Server was configured to be multi – homed, with two network interfaces.  The output of the ifconfig Linux command when executed on the Gateway/Server is shown in \n\nFigure 6: Gateway/Server’s ifconfig Output.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Gateway/Server’s ifconfig Output\n\nAs can be seen in \n\nFigure 6: Gateway/Server’s ifconfig Output, the Gateway/Server is connected to both the 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.2.0 networks.\nIn order for the Gateway/Server to allow pings to the IP address 8.8.8.8, Network Address Translation (NAT) was implemented as shown in \n\nFigure 7: Gateway/Server’s NAT Setup below:\n\n\n\nFigure 7:Gateway/Server’s NAT Setup\n\nIn \n\nFigure 7: Gateway/Server’s NAT Setup, a Masquerade entry was added that allowed for network address translation for the reply pings coming back from the pinged IP address 8.8.8.8).  If this entry didn’t exist, then reply pings would never be received by the Client.\nA simple web server was implemented on the Gateway/Server.  The web content for the server was the message “Welcome to Demo and Test!”.  This content was stored in an html file as shown in \n\nFigure 8: Gateway/Server’s Web Content below:\n\n\n\nFigure 8:Gateway/Server’s Web Content\n\nAn Apache  webserver was started Gateway/Server.

The firewall resided on an Open Virtual Switch that implements the OpenFlow protocol.  A POX   instance acts as the controller for the Open Virtual Switch.  Containers are instantiated using Mininet to create four containers.  Layer 2 and Layer 3 firewall rules are applied to the controller using a firewall application running the application plane.  Various tests are performed in order to test the functionality of the firewall application.\n\nThe network setup for this Project is shown in \n\nFigure 10: Project 2 Network Setup below:\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Project 2 Network Setup\n\nFigure 10: Project 2 Network Setup shows the network topology.

Firewall rules were added per the Project instructions and tests were performed to check the functionality of the firewall with the new rules.\n\nTo setup the controller, the following POX command was issued as shown in \n\nFigure 11: POX Instantiation Command:\n\n\n\nFigure 11:POX Instantiation Command\n\nThe POX instantiation command shown in \n\nFigure 11: POX Instantiation Command starts a POX controller using the OpenFlow protocol, using port 6655, with a Layer 2 learning firewall and a Layer 3 forwarding firewall.\n\nTo setup the Containers (Clients), the following Mininet  command was issued as shown in \n\nFigure 12: Host Network Configurations below:\n\n\n\nFigure 12:Host Network Configurations\n\nIssuing the command shown in \n\nFigure 12: Mininet Instantiation Command created four containers that attached themselves to the Open Virtual Switch listening on port 6655, with MAC (Media Access Control) functionality enabled.

Links were added between the hosts and s1.  Once the links were established, the hosts were configured with IP addresses and the Controller and Switch were started.\n\nThe default IP addesses given to the hosts were not in compliance with the Project requirements; therefore, their IP addresses were changed using the Linux ifconfig command.  The results of the issued ifconfig commands for each host are shown in the following figures (\n\nFigure 14, \n\nFigure 15, \n\nFigure 16, \n\nFigure 17) below:\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Host 1’s ifconfig Output\n\n\n\nFigure 15:Host 2’s ifconfig Output\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Host 3’s ifconfig Output\n\n\n\nFigure 17:Host 4’s ifconfig Output\n\nAs can be seen in \n\nFigure 14, \n\nFigure 15, \n\nFigure 16, \n\nFigure 17: Host Network Configurations, every host’s IP address was changed from the default 10.0.0.0 network to the 192.168.2.0 network.","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-2-sdn-based-stateless-firewall","position":33},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 3: SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project","lvl3":"Project Overviews, Setup and Descriptions","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-3-sdn-based-dos-attacks-and-mitigation-project-1","position":34},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 3: SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project","lvl3":"Project Overviews, Setup and Descriptions","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"The purpose of this project is to learn about Software Defined Networking and implementing Denial of Service (DoS) attack mitigation.

Training data for the machine learning models is provided by the Course Team.  Two distinct models are trained and tested against three different test sets.  Testing / validation accuracy and loss are determined, as well as construction of a confusion matrix for the three separate testing conditions.  An assessment is made to determine the model with the most testing accuracy, and then to figure out why that model fares better than others.  This determination involves examining the training data and testing data to notice any particular patterns in the categories and subcategories of attacks.\n\nThe analysis was performed in a Virtualbox Linux virtual machine (VM) guest running on a Windows 11 host.  The Linux system is Parrot OS.  The VM was assigned 12/16 processors and 24 Gbytes of RAM.  Unfortunately, Virtualbox does not support GPU passthrough to the guest and using the GPU for model training was not possible.  Model training was performed on the CPU with an average training time of about 2.5 hours per scenario.\nThe course team provided the bare-bones Python code necessary to make inroads into the Project.  Specifically, a data extractor script was provided to extract specific classes of attacks from the NSL-KDD standard cybersecurity dataset.  The data extractor script was migrated into a Jupyter Lab notebook running a Python 3.11 kernel.  The notebook is provided as an attachment to this Report \n\nData Extractor.  Migrating the data extractor script into Jupyter Lab provided a means of monitoring the operation of the script in logical sections.  The data extractor script was used to create training and testing data per the Project specifications.\n\nAfter the training and testing datasets were extracted, the next script that was provided by the Course Team and migrated into Jupyter Lab was FNN_sample.py.  This script contained the bulk of the work necessary to be completed for the Project.  The script was modified to use the training and testing datasets per the Project specifications.  To facilitate reuse, a separate Jupyter Lab notebook file was create for each of the three scenarios.  These notebooks are provided as an attachment to this report \n\nFNN Sample SA, \n\nFNN Sample SB, \n\nFNN Sample SC.\n\nThe Python Modules Keras  and Tensorflow  were the backends that provided the framework for training and testing the Feedforward Neural Networks.\n\nThe first step was to obtain the NSL-KDD  dataset per the Project instructions.  The dataset was obtained and examined within Jupyter Lab.  The first few lines of the dataset are shown in \n\nFigure 19: NSL-KDD Dataset Excerpt below:\n\n\n\nFigure 19:NSL-KDD Dataset Excerpt\n\nFigure 19: NSL-KDD Dataset Excerpt shows that the data is a CSV file with many rows and columns (only a few rows and columns are visible above).  A description is provided in an attached HTML file.  Task 2 of the Project instructions called out using the KDDTrain+.txt and KDDTest+.txt files, and obtaining attack classes and subclasses from them.  The KDDTrain+.csv and KDDTest+.txt raw data is opened in Jupyter Lab and shown in \n\nFigure 20: KDDTrain+.txt (partial) and \n\nFigure 21: KDDTest+.txt (partial) below:\n\n\n\nFigure 20:KDDTrain+.txt (partial)\n\n\n\nFigure 21:KDDTest+.txt (partial)\n\nIn \n\nFigure 20: KDDTrain+.txt (partial) and \n\nFigure 21: KDDTest+.txt (partial), we can see that the files contain large amounts of categorical and numerical data.  The class labels are at the second to last column (not shown for brevity).  \tAs denoted by their filenames, the data in KDDTrain+.txt will be used to train the machine learning model, and KDDTest+.txt will be used for testing the machine learning models.\n\nTask 2 of the Project calls out the following scenarios shown in \n\nTable 1: Train / Test Scenarios:\n\nTable 1:Train / Test Scenarios\n\nDatasets\n\nScenario A (SA)\n\nScenario B (SB)\n\nScenario C (SC)\n\nTraining Dataset\n\nA1, A3, N\n\nA1, A2, N\n\nA1, A2, N\n\nTesting Dataset\n\nA2, A4, N\n\nA1, N\n\nA1, A2, A3, N\n\nWe can see that there are three scenarios with different testing requirements, although scenario B and scenario C share a common training dataset.

The first item that needs to be established is how to differentiate between normal and DoS traffic.  For nice round numbers, I have decided to use 10 connections in a 3 second time window.  The L3Firewall.py application was modified to include these new constants as shown in \n\nFigure 31: L3Firewall.py DoS Detection Threshold Constants below:\n\n\n\nFigure 31:L3Firewall.py DoS Detection Threshold Constants\n\nWhen examining the provided L3Firewall.py, I noticed that there was a function called:replyToIP(self, packet, match, event, fwconfig)\n\nand it contained the logic for processing IP packets.  I therefore decided that the logic to detect a DoS style attack should go into this function.\n\nThe code that was added to the \n\nreplyToIP function is shown in \n\nDoS Detection Logic below:# ************* DDOS Mods start here *******************\nlog.debug(\"[*] Entered DDOS in replyToIP\")\ncurrent_time = time.time()\n\n# Create a new entry to track the new connection for possible offense\nif srcmac not in connection_counter:\n    connection_counter[srcmac] = []\nconnection_counter[srcmac].append(current_time)\n\n# Clean up connections that don't meet offensive threshold\t\t\nconnection_counter[srcmac] = \\\n    [item for item in connection_counter[srcmac] if (current_time - item) <= BLOCK_TIME_WINDOW]\n\n# If the number of connections from the same MAC address exceeds the offense threshold, block.\nif len(connection_counter[srcmac]) > BLOCK_THRESHOLD:\n    log.debug(\"[*] Blocking MAC address %s for DDOS \" % srcmac)\n    self.blockMAC(event, srcmac)\n    return\n# ************* DDOS Mods end here *******************\n\nIn the code snippet shown in \n\nDoS Detection Logic, an if statement checks whether or not a source MAC address is already in the connection_counter list of lists.  This list of lists contains a collection of MAC addresses that have not been seen before by the function and are now to be considered as possible DoS candidates.  If the source MAC is not in the connection_counter list of lists, then the current time is appended to the list corresponding to that source MAC address.\n\nThe next line is a list comprehension that removes any source MAC address whose connection time is greater than the BLOCK_TIME_WINDOW constant, which is 3 seconds.  This constant was chosen heuristically in order to achieve reasonable results during testing.  Connections that exceed the  BLOCK_TIME_WINDOW connection time are considered normal.\n\nThe next line is an if statement that checks if the length of the list for a particular source MAC address exceeds the BLOCK_THRESHOLD constant, which is 10 connection attempts.  If a particular source MAC address has 10 connections attempts, each lasting less than 3 seconds, then it is considered a source of DoS style attacks.  The source MAC is then sent to the \n\nblockMAC() function, shown below:# ************* My mods start here *******************\n# Create function to block offending MAC address\ndef blockMAC(self, event, mac_address):\n    # Add a flow rule to block a MAC address permanently\n    log.debug(\"[*] Entered blockMAC\")\n    msg = of.ofp_flow_mod()\n    match = of.ofp_match()\n    match.dl_src = EthAddr(mac_address)\n    match.dl_type = pkt.ethernet.IP_TYPE\n    msg.match = match\n    msg.priority = 65535 # high priority\n    msg.action = []\n    event.connection.send(msg)\n    log.debug(\"[*] Permanently blocked the MAC address %s\" % mac_address)\n    log.debug(\"[*] Exiting blockMAC\")\n# ************* My mods end here ********************\n\nIn the \n\nblockMAC() function, code is present that sends a message to the OpenFlow controller’s firewall to add an entry for the offending source MAC.  When this message is sent to the controller’s firewall, the offending MAC address is blocked.","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-3-sdn-based-dos-attacks-and-mitigation-project-2","position":51},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 4: Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection Project","lvl3":"Explanation of Solution","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-4-machine-learning-based-anomaly-detection-project","position":52},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 4: Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection Project","lvl3":"Explanation of Solution","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"In order to extract the specified scenarios from the provided training and testing datasets, a Python script called dataExtractor.py was provided by the course team.

Separated out training and testing datasets were then saved as CSV files for use in the next set of IPython  Notebooks that perform the actual training and testing of the machine learning models.  For the A1 and A3 training datasets, this code cell is shown below in \n\nTraining A1 and A3 Dataset Generation:\n\nprint(\"Creating training set.....\\n\")\nsetA_train = []\n\nif (training_attack_class_list[0][0] != 0) and \\\n    (len(training_attack_class_list[0]) != num_attack_class):\n\n    for i in range(len(X_train)):\n        # exp., X_train[i, -2] is the label of attack subclass, and attacks_subClass[training_attack_class_list[0][j]-1] identify the selected attack class\n        if str.lower(str(X_train[i,-2])) == 'normal':\n            setA_train.append(X_train[i])\n\n        for j in range(len(training_attack_class_list[0])):\n            if str.lower(str(X_train[i, -2])) in attacks_subClass[training_attack_class_list[0][j]-1]:\n                setA_train.append(X_train[i])\n\n    trainingFileName=\"Training\"\n\n    for i in range(len(training_attack_class_list[0])):\n        trainingFileName = trainingFileName + \"-a\" + str(training_attack_class_list[0][i])\n\n    trainingFileName = trainingFileName + file_extension\n\n    np.savetxt(trainingFileName, setA_train, delimiter=',', fmt=\"%s\" )\n\n    print(\"Files \" + trainingFileName + \" have been created in the same folder this script resides\\n\")\n\nelif (len(training_attack_class_list[0]) == num_attack_class):\n    print(\"No changes is needed for training dataset!\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No attack classes are chosen, thus no new training file is created!\\n\")\n\n\n\nSimilar methods were used to create the other training and testing datasets with subclasses per \n\nTable 1: Train / Test Scenarios.\n\nThe created training and testing datasets were then imported into memory as Pandas dataframes.  Since the datasets contained both the features and labels, they needed to be further subdivided into training / testing features and labels.  The training features were extracted with the following code cell shown in \n\nModel Training Features below:\n\nX_train = dataset_train.iloc[:, 0:-2].values\nX_train\n\n\n\nThe training labels were extracted with the following code cell shown in below: \n\nModel Training Labels:\n\ny_train = []\nfor i in range(len(label_column_train)):\n    if label_column_train[i] == 'normal':\n        y_train.append(0)\n    else:\n        y_train.append(1)\n\n# Convert list to array\ny_train = np.array(y_train)\n\n\n\ny_train\n\n\n\nWe can see in \n\nModel Training Labels Code that if the training label was ‘Normal’ a ‘0’ is appended; whereas if the label was a string other than ‘Normal’ (i.e. some kind of attack), a ‘1’ was appended.  Similar operations were performed for the testing data sets.  The training and testing features contained categorical data that needed to be converted into numeric data for model training and testing.  One – Hot Encoding was selected as the method to perform this operation.  For the training feature dataset, the following code cells illustrates this operation:\n\n# The following code work Python 3.7 or newer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nct = ColumnTransformer(\n     # The column numbers to be transformed ([1, 2, 3] represents three columns to be transferred)\n    [('one_hot_encoder', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), [1,2,3])],\n    # Leave the rest of the columns untouched\n    remainder='passthrough'\n)\nX_train = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X_train), dtype=np.float64)\nX_test  = np.array(ct.transform(X_test) , dtype=np.float64)\n\n\n\nX_train\n\n\n\nIn addition to dealing with categorical data, scaling was necessary to prevent a particular feature from over – biasing the training data.  The \n\nSKLearn StandardScaler() class was selected for this operation.  The code cells \n\nPerform Feature Scaling on Training Data Code and \n\nPerform Feature Scaling on Testing Data Code Output show the results:\n\n# Perform feature scaling. For ANN you can use StandardScaler, for RNNs recommended is \n# MinMaxScaler. \n# referece: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html\n# https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsc = StandardScaler()\nX_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)  # Scaling to the range [0,1]\nX_test  = sc.fit_transform(X_test)\n\n\n\nX_train\n\n\n\nThe training features are now normalized with a mean of zero.  A similar operation was performed for the testing data.\n\nOnce the training and testing data are cleaned and prepared, a Fully – connected Neural Network (FNN) can be constructed.  The FNN is defined as shown in the \n\nDefining FNN Structure code cell below:\n\n# Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer, 6 nodes, input_dim specifies the number of variables\n# rectified linear unit activation function relu, reference: https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/\n# Adding the input layer with Input() and the first hidden layer\nclassifier.add(Input(shape=(len(X_train[0]),)))  # Input layer\nclassifier.add(Dense(units=6, kernel_initializer='uniform', activation='relu'))\n\n# Adding the second hidden layer\nclassifier.add(Dense(units=6, kernel_initializer='uniform', activation='relu'))\n\n# Adding the output layer\nclassifier.add(Dense(units=1, kernel_initializer='uniform', activation='sigmoid'))\n\n\n\nAdditional Context from Copilot\n\nIn the \n\nDefining FNN Structure code cell, we can see that the FNN has an input layer of 6 neurons, a hidden layer of 6 neurons and an output layer of one neuron.  The activation function for the hidden layer is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and the activation function for the output layer is Sigmoid.\n\nThe model was compiled with the parameters as shown in the \n\nCompilation of FNN code cell below:\n\n# Compiling the ANN, \n\n# Gradient descent algorithm “adam“, Reference: https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/\n\n# This loss is for a binary classification problems and is defined in Keras as “binary_crossentropy“, Reference: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-choose-loss-functions-when-training-deep-learning-neural-networks/\n\nclassifier.compile(\n    optimizer = 'adam', \n    loss = 'binary_crossentropy', \n    metrics = ['accuracy']\n    )\n\n\n\nWebsite Referenced in \n\nDefining FNN Structure and \n\nCompilation of FNN\n\nThe code for defining and compiling the FNN was inspired by the following website:\n\n\nhttps://​machinelearningmastery​.com\n\nIn \n\nCompilation of FNN, we can see that the FNN was compiled with the ADAM optimizer, a ‘binary_crossentropy’ loss function, and the metric is ‘accuracy’.  The choices for these hyperparameters were made based on the provided code from the Course team.\n\nAdditional Context from Copilot\n\nADAM optimizer: an adaptive first‑and‑second‑moment SGD (momentum + RMSProp) optimizer (good default; typically uses lr=0.001) that speeds and stabilizes training.\n\nbinary_crossentropy loss: the log loss for binary targets; for a true label y∈{0,1} and predicted probability p, loss = - \\big(y\\log p + (1-y)\\log(1-p)\\big). It’s appropriate for a single-output sigmoid FNN.\n\naccuracy metric: fraction of examples classified correctly (Keras uses a default 0.5 threshold on the sigmoid output).\n\nThe model was then fit and saved as a Keras file.  This was done to avoid retraining the model during code development since model trainnig takes a very long time. The code cell \n\nTrain Model \n\nSave Model to Keras Fileshows the code cells that perform the training and saving of the traning history data.\n\n# Fitting the ANN to the Training set\n# Train the model so that it learns a good (or good enough) mapping of rows of input data to the output classification.\n# add verbose=0 to turn off the progress report during the training\n# To run the whole training dataset as one Batch, assign batch size: BatchSize=X_train.shape[0#]\n#classifierHistory = classifier.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = BatchSize, epochs = NumEpoch)\n\n\n\nclassifier.save(\"fitted_FNN_model_SA.keras\")  # Save the model in HDF5 format\n\n# Save the history\n#import json\n#with open(\"fitted_FNN_model_history_SA.json\", \"w\") as f:\n#    json.dump(classifierHistory.history, f)\n\n\n\nNote\n\nIn the code cell \n\nTrain Model, the command \n\nclassifier.fit() is commented out to avoid retraining the model during code development.  The trained model is saved as shown in the code cell \n\nSave Model to Keras File and is recalled from the Keras file in the code cell \n\nLoad Model from Keras File and Load Training History from JSON File.\n\nOnce the model was trained, it can be reloaded at any time using the Keras load_model() function.  The model’s training history is loaded from a JSON file.  The following code cell in \n\nLoad Model from Keras File and Load Training History from JSON File displays this process:\n\n#from keras.models import load_model\n\n#classifier = load_model(\"fitted_FNN_model_SA.keras\")  # Load the saved model\n\n# Load the history\n#import json\n#with open(\"fitted_FNN_model_history_SA.json\", \"r\") as f:\n#    classifierHistory = json.load(f)\n\n\n\nNote\n\nIn the code cell \n\nLoad Model from Keras File and Load Training History from JSON File, the commands are commented out to avoid overwriting the trained model and training history during code development.\n\nSimilar operations were performed for all Scenarios.  Now that the models are trained, they can be tested per the conditions described in \n\nTable 1: Train / Test Scenarios.","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#scenario-c-train-test-configuration-in-python","position":59},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl3":"Description of Results","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#description-of-results","position":60},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl3":"Description of Results","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#description-of-results","position":61},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 1: Packet Filter Firewall (iptables) Project","lvl3":"Description of Results","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-1-packet-filter-firewall-iptables-project-2","position":62},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 1: Packet Filter Firewall (iptables) Project","lvl3":"Description of Results","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"Once the webserver was setup on the Gateway/Server, accessing the webpage using the Linux command \n\ncurl from the client was possible.

A successful test of HTTP requests being blocked from the three other Hosts are shown in \n\nFigure 46: HTTP Requests to Node 2 Blocked below:\n\n\n\nFigure 45:HTTP Server Setup on Host 2\n\n\n\nFigure 46:HTTP Requests to Node 2 Blocked\n\nA Project requirement is that MAC address filtering is performed from Host 2 to Host 4.  To perform this test, the Linux command \n\narping was used.  A successful test showing the MAC address filtering from Host 2 to Host 4 was performed and the results are shown in \n\nFigure 47: Host 2 to Host 4 MAC Address Filtering below:\n\n\n\nFigure 47:Host 2 to Host 4 MAC Address Filtering\n\nIt can be seen in \n\nFigure 47: Host 2 to Host 4 MAC Address Filtering that only one response is received from Node 4, while testing \n\narping from Node 1 to Node 3 produced many responses.  This is taken as traffic from Node 2 to Node 4 is blocked based on MAC addresses, since the first reply is necessary for the Controller to learn the flow rule.\n\nA Project requirement is that both TCP and UDP traffic are blocked from Host 1 to Host 2.  The \n\nhping3 Linux command was used to send both TCP and UDP packets.  A successful test of TCP packets being blocked when sent from Host 1 to Host 2 is shown in \n\nFigure 48: Check Blocking of TCP Traffic from Host 1 to Host 2 below:\n\n\n\nFigure 48:Check Blocking of TCP Traffic from Host 1 to Host 2\n\nLikewise, for UDP traffic, a successful test showing that the UDP traffic from Host 1 to Host 2 is being blocked is shown in \n\nFigure 49: Check Blocking of UDP Traffic from Host 1 to Host 2 below:\n\n\n\nFigure 49:Check Blocking of UDP Traffic from Host 1 to Host 2\n\nAs can be seen from \n\nFigure 48: Check Blocking of TCP Traffic from Host 1 to Host 2 and \n\nFigure 49: Check Blocking of UDP Traffic from Host 1 to Host 2, both TCP and UDP traffic was successfully blocked from Host 1 to Host 2.","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-2-sdn-based-stateless-firewall-project-1","position":71},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 3: SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project","lvl3":"Description of Results","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-3-sdn-based-dos-attacks-and-mitigation-project-3","position":72},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 3: SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project","lvl3":"Description of Results","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"As a baseline, a DoS flood test was performed from Host 1 to 192.168.2.20 (Host 2) with a spoofed source address of 10.10.10.1.

Again, a DoS was started as shown in \n\nFigure 54: DoS Attack from Host 1 to Host 2 with Spoofed Source Address of 10.10.10.1 below:\n\n\n\nFigure 54:DoS Attack from Host 1 to Host 2 with Spoofed Source Address of 10.10.10.1\n\nAs before, we observed the traffic flows on the OpenFlow switch.  The observation was performed using the Linux \n\nwatch command, so as to be able to observe changes more easily without having to notice changes in a rapidly scrolling screen.  The results of the Linux \n\nwatch command are shown in \n\nFigure 55: Watch of OpenFlow Switch Traffic Flows.  We notice that a flow rule was added to drop packets from MAC address ending in 01 (i.e. the offending MAC address).\n\n\n\nFigure 55:Watch of OpenFlow Switch Traffic Flows\n\nThe output of the POX controller indicates that a MAC address was blocked.  This is shown in \n\nFigure 56: POX Controller Output Indicating Offending MAC Address Permanently Blocked below:\n\n\n\nFigure 56:POX Controller Output Indicating Offending MAC Address Permanently Blocked\n\nPinging between other hosts is still possible as the switch blocks the DoS attack from Host 1.

This means that of all of the positive predictions, 0.8 of the predictions are correct for the Normal Class, and 0.88 are correct for the Attack Class.\n\nHowever, when considering the Recall (i.e. True Positive Rate), we see that of all of the actual positives, the model correctly identified 0.96 of the Normal Classes, but only 0.56 of the Attack Classes.  Therefore, we can say that the model struggles to correctly predict when an attack is occuring.  This is somewhat not surprising since the model was tested on subclasses that it was not trained on.\n\nFor Scenario B, we have the following confusion matrix shown in \n\nFigure 74: Scenario B Confusion Matrix below:\n\n\n\nFigure 74:Scenario B Confusion Matrix\n\nThe confusion matrix shown in \n\nFigure 74: Scenario B Confusion Matrix indicates that Scenario B has a much lower amount of False Negatives (1558 vs 2352) than Scenario A.\n\nThe model scores for Scenario B are shown in \n\nFigure 75: Scenario B Model Scores below:\n\n\n\nFigure 75:Scenario B Model Scores\n\nWe observe from \n\nFigure 75: Scenario B Model Scores, the precision is 0.85 for the Normal Class and 0.86 for the Attack Class.  This means that of all of the positive predictions, 0.85 of the predictions are correct for the Normal Class, and 0.86 are correct for the Attack Class.  The precision of the Scenario A model are just slightly better than the Scenario B model; however, the Scenario B model has drastically better recall (i.e. true positive rate) performance.\n\nWe can see from \n\nFigure 75: Scenario B Model Scores, that the model for Scenario B had a recall (i.e. true positive rate) of 0.9 for the Normal Class and a recall (i.e. true positive rate) of 0.79 for the Attack Class.  The model in Scenario B performs much better in identifying actual attacks when compared to the model in Scenario A (recall of 0.79 vs recall of 0.56).\n\nFor Scenario C, we have the following confusion matrix shown in \n\nFigure 76: Scenario C Confusion Matrix below:\n\n\n\nFigure 76:Scenario C Confusion Matrix\n\nThe confusion matrix shown in \n\nFigure 76: Scenario C Confusion Matrix seems to indicate many False Negatives (2178); however, as a ratio to True Negatives (8939) and True Positives (7770), the model in this Scenario seems to perform better than the models in both Scenarios A and B.\n\nThe scores for the model in Scenario C are shown \n\nFigure 77: Scenario C Model Scores below:\n\n\n\nFigure 77:Scenario C Model Scores\n\nObserving the model score shown in \n\nFigure 77: Scenario C Model Scores, we see that the model in Scenario C has comparable precision (i.e. proportion of predicted positives that are correct) and recall (i.e. proportion of actual positives correctly identified) to the model in Scenario B, but has higher support (i.e. the number of actual occurrences of a class in the dataset) for those scores.  What is astonishing is that the model has such high precision and recall despite being tested on data that it has not been trained on (i.e. trained on subclasses A and B, tested on sublasses A, B and C).\n\nIt is observed that the model in Scenario A performed worse than the models in Scenario B and Scenario C when the testing subclasses differed from the training subclasses.  Astonishingly, even though scenario C was never training on attack subclass A3, it performed slightly better than scenario B.  Scenario B was trained on attack subclasses A1 and A2, but was tested on attack subclass A1.  Since it was already exposed to this attack subclass, it fared pretty well.  Scenario C was trained on attack subclasses A1 and A2, but not on A3.  Despite this, it still fared very well, even slightly better than scenario B.  This indicates that attack subclass A1 and A2 have some feature similarities to attack subclass C.\n\nWe can see from the bar charts in \n\nFigure 22: A1 and A3 Training Dataset Distribution of Attack Types and \n\nFigure 24: A2 and A4 Testing Dataset Distribution of Attack Types that for scenario A, there is no overlap in attack names.  The only commonality is the normal column.  Since the normal column magnitude is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the attacks, the model must be learning to recognize what is normal and using this to make a distinction.\n\nFor Scenario B, we can see from the bar charts in \n\nFigure 23: A1 and A2 Training Dataset Distribution of Attack Types and \n\nFigure 25: A1 Testing Dataset Distribution of Attack Types, that in addition to overlap on the normal class, there is significant overlap for the attack classes.\n\nFor Scenario C, we can see from the bar charts in \n\nFigure 23: A1 and A2 Training Dataset Distribution of Attack Types and \n\nFigure 26: A1, A2 and A3 Testing Dataset Distribution of Attack Types that in addition to significant normal class overlap, there is significant overlap in attack types, as well as additional attack types not seen in the training data.\n\nWe can get an even better idea of the performance of the model when observing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC).  For Scenario A, we have the following ROC and AUC shown in \n\nFigure 78: Scenario A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under the Curve below:\n\n\n\nFigure 78:Scenario A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under the Curve\n\nThe ROC curve shown in \n\nFigure 78: Scenario A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under the Curve shows that it is difficult for this model to achieve a good True Positive Rate without starting to get unacceptably high False Positive rates.  The model is about 30 % (i.e. 0.79 - 0.5) better than random guessing as indicated by the Area Under Curve.\n\nFor Scenario B, we have the ROC and AUC shown in \n\nFigure 79: Scenario B Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under the Curve.  The ROC curve for Scenario B shows that this model is much better at achieving a high True Positive rate without a high False Positive rate.  The model is about 40% (i.e. 0.89 - 0.5) better than random guessing as indicated by the Area Under Curve.\n\n\n\nFigure 79:Scenario B Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under the Curve\n\nFor Scenario C, we have the ROC and AUC shown in \n\nFigure 80: Scenario C Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under the Curve.  Scenario C has a ROC and AUC similar to scenario B.  This makes sense, since they were trained on the same dataset.  What is astonishing is that scenario C is tested on a wider variety of data but still performs slightly better than scenario B as seen from the AUC (0.9 for Scenario C vs 0.89 for Scenario B).  The conclusion is that there were enough similarities in the training and test data so that the model in Scenario C performed well.\n\n\n\nFigure 80:Scenario C Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under the Curve","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#display-confusion-matrices-and-scores","position":77},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl3":"Description of my Contributions to the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#description-of-my-contributions-to-the-project","position":78},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl3":"Description of my Contributions to the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#description-of-my-contributions-to-the-project","position":79},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 1: Packet Filter Firewall (iptables) Project","lvl3":"Description of my Contributions to the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-1-packet-filter-firewall-iptables-project-3","position":80},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 1: Packet Filter Firewall (iptables) Project","lvl3":"Description of my Contributions to the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"For Project 1, I renamed the hostnames of the Virtual Machines (VMs) to ‘Client’ and ‘Server’ to enhance clarity of the report and prevent confusion as to which machine I am working with.

The network traffic that was examined with Wireshark did not exhibit any anomalous behavior that precipitated the firewall shutting down.","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-2-sdn-based-stateless-firewall-project-3","position":93},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 3: SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project","lvl3":"Explanation of New Skills, Techniques, or Knowledge Acquired from the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-3-sdn-based-dos-attacks-and-mitigation-project-5","position":94},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 3: SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation Project","lvl3":"Explanation of New Skills, Techniques, or Knowledge Acquired from the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"An Open Virtual Switch was set up and 4 containers were connected to it.  A DoS attack was performed that indicated that the baseline firewall configuration was susceptible to such attacks.  The \n\nL3Firewall.py application was modified to detect and permanently block the offending host by MAC address.  Successful operation of the DoS mitigation was demonstrated.\n\nI learned much about how the Open Virtual Switch operates and deals with traffic flows by observing the addition of flow rules to the learning firewall.  When modifying the \n\nL3Firewall.py application, I learned about the format of the procedural calls and functions within the Open Virtual Switch framework that examines flows and packets.  These procedural calls and functions can then be used to block traffic that matches the criteria of a DoS style attack.","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-3-sdn-based-dos-attacks-and-mitigation-project-5","position":95},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 4: Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection Project","lvl3":"Explanation of New Skills, Techniques, or Knowledge Acquired from the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-4-machine-learning-based-anomaly-detection-project-3","position":96},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl4":"Project 4: Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection Project","lvl3":"Explanation of New Skills, Techniques, or Knowledge Acquired from the Project","lvl2":"CSE548 Advanced Network Security: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"In Project 4, we were provided with lots of Python code to get started.  My favorite method of performing Data Science is to use IPython Notebooks in the Jupyter Lab environment.  I used the provided \n\ndataExtractor.py to create a IPython Notebook based on this script to create the training subclass datasets.  Data label and preprocessing methods were taken out of the provided data_preprocessor.py and distinctLabelExtractor.py scripts and incorporated into more general Notebooks called \n\nFNN Sample SA, \n\nFNN Sample SB, \n\nFNN Sample SC.  It was decided to use three separate Notebooks to faciliate code reuse without having to rename general variable names.\nSince the model training takes a very long time, I learned how to save the trained model into a Keras file, as well as saving the training accuracy and loss histories into JSON files for later recall.  At first glance, it was not trivial to identify the best performing model, since the model in Scenario A had such a high training accuracy.  Therefore, I had to learn to investigate the precision, recall, ROC and AUC characteristics of each model to get a better feel for which model peformed the best.","type":"content","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#project-4-machine-learning-based-anomaly-detection-project-3","position":97},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl2":"CSE572 Data Mining: Portfolio Project Report"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sections/mcs-portfolio-project/mcs-portfolio-project#cse572-data-mining-portfolio-project-report","position":98},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) - Portfolio Project","lvl2":"CSE572 Data Mining: Portfolio Project Report"},"content":"Under Construction\n\nOpenFlow Switch Specification. \n\nhttps://​opennetworking​.org/\n\nApache HTTP Server. \n\nhttps://​httpd​.apache​.org/\n\nUsing the POX SDN Controller. \n\nhttps://​brianlinkletter​.com​/2015​/04​/using​-the​-pox​-sdn​-controller/\n\nMininet: An Instant Virtual Network on your Laptop (or other PC). \n\nhttp://mininet.org/\n\nKeras. \n\nhttps://keras.io/\n\nTensorFlow. \n\nhttps://​www​.tensorflow​.org/\n\nNSL-KDD Dataset. \n\nhttps://​www​.unb​.ca​/cic​/datasets​/nsl​.html\n\nScikit-learn. \n\nhttps://​scikit​-learn​.org/\n\nPandas. \n\nhttps://​pandas​.pydata​.org/\n\nIPython. \n\nhttps://​ipython​.org/\n\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). \n\nInternet Control Message Protocol, \n\nhttps://​tools​.ietf​.org​/html​/rfc792\n\niptraf-ng is an ncurses-based IP LAN monitor that generates various network statistics including TCP info, UDP counts, ICMP   and OSPF information, Ethernet load info, node stats, IP checksum errors, and others.
