It is called shellcode because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. However, attempts at replacing the term have not gained wide acceptance.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"r5FSYSlgse"}],"key":"Advad2skNE"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"section .text\nglobal _start","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"PEBERd0yxR"}],"key":"qfo8s8zzIF"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"_start:\n; Your assembly code here","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"key":"FmoukmVh3M"}],"key":"kKHPgcA5F2"},{"type":"code","lang":"","value":"; Exit the program\nmov eax, 1\nxor ebx, ebx\nint 0x80","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"kTbpPXGM9B"}],"key":"e2rDF9NoV0"}],"key":"fGlTvr8Vet"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}}}
