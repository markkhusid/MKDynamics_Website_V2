It is called shellcode because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. However, attempts at replacing the term have not gained wide acceptance.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"H9SEZr1nvF"}],"key":"iWKjmDC8Lq"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"section .text\nglobal _start","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"rSu4D8Hir5"}],"key":"um0DdbYRPj"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"_start:\n; Your assembly code here","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"key":"o33uVaIZe7"}],"key":"o867kKW1E7"},{"type":"code","lang":"","value":"; Exit the program\nmov eax, 1\nxor ebx, ebx\nint 0x80","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"NYaoGGBNQl"}],"key":"zBuIeor866"}],"key":"CzUegMG9CQ"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}}}
