\subparagraph{Section: Implicit vs Explicit Loops}

In this section we will be following along with the examples from ``Fortran for scientific programming'', a \href{https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/fortran-for-scientific-computing}{MOOC that is hosted by FutureLearn}.  Course material can be found on Github \href{https://github.com/gjbex/Fortran-MOOC}{here} . We will use Jupyter Lab with the Fortran Package Manager (fpm) to facilitate creation of this Jupyter Book.
