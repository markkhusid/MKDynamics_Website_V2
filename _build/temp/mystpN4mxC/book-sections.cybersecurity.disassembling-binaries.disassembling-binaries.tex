\subsubsection{Disassembling Binaries}

In this section we will disassemble binaries generated from the C, C++, Fortran, Ada, and Pascal high-level languages for the i386, AMD64, ARM32 and ARM64 platforms.  We will make side by side comparisons to learn to recognize how different programming structures convert into assembly language and machine code.
