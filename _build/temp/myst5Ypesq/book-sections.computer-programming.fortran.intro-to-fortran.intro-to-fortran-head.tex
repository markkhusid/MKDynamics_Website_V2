\paragraph{Introduction to Programming Using Fortran}

In this section we will be following along with the examples from ``\href{https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/introduction-to-programming-using-fortran-95-2003-2008}{Introduction to Programming Using Fortran 95/2003/2008}'' by Ed Jorgensen (March 2018 / Version 3.0.51).  We will use Jupyter Lab with the Fortran Package Manager (fpm) to facilitate creation of this Jupyter Book.
