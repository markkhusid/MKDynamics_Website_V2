\subparagraph{Introduction}

In this section, we will go over the tutorial code from the Kaggle data science platform. Kaggle is a subsidiary of Google LLC that provides a platform for data science and machine learning competitions. It is a platform for predictive modeling and analytics competitions in which companies and researchers post data and statisticians and data miners compete to produce the best models for predicting and describing the data.

The platform is designed to allow users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. Kaggle got its start by offering machine learning competitions and now also offers a public data platform, a cloud-based workbench for data science, and short form AI education.
