\paragraph{Stack 0}

\subparagraph{Introduction}

Stack0 is the first challenge in the Protostar series of binary exploitation challenges. The challenge is designed to help you learn the basic techniques of binary exploitation by exploiting a simple stack buffer overflow vulnerability to modify a variable.

\subparagraph{Objective}

The objective of the Stack0 challenge is to exploit a stack buffer overflow vulnerability to modify a variable in the program. The program reads a string from the user and copies it into a buffer on the stack. The buffer is not large enough to hold the string, so the program overflows the buffer and overwrites a variable on the stack.

\subparagraph{Architecture}

The Stack0 challenge was solved and analyzed on the following architectures:

\subparagraph{x86 32-Bit Platform}

\subparagraph{AMD 64-Bit Platform}

\subparagraph{ARM32}

\subparagraph{ARM64}
