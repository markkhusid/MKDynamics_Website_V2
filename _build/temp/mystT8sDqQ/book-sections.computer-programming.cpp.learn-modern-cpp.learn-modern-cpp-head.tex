\subparagraph{Introduction}

In this section, we will discuss and experiment with C++ programming. C++ is a high-level programming language that is used for general-purpose programming. It is a compiled language that is especially suited to systems programming and applications requiring high performance. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s as an extension of the C programming language. It has since been updated and improved, and is still widely used in systems programming, game development, and high-performance computing.
