\subparagraph{ARM 64 Bit}

This section contains examples of Fortran code compiled for ARM64 architecture. Each example demonstrates a specific operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers. The code is designed to be disassembled and analyzed to understand the underlying assembly instructions and the way they correspond to the high-level Fortran code for the ARM64 architecture.
