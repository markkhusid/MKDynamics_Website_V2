The backdoored web server is a simple web server that listens on a specified port and serves files from a specified directory.

    "The provided C code implements a basic HTTP server with a backdoor functionality that listens for incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and executes commands embedded in the URL of the request if specific conditions are met. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Functionalities**\n",
    "1. **Socket Communication:**\n",
    "   - The server listens on a specified port for incoming connections.\n",
    "   - It processes HTTP requests from clients and sends appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backdoor Command Execution:**\n",
    "   - If the URL in the HTTP request contains `/exec/`, the server interprets the string after `/exec/` as a system command.\n",
    "   - This command is executed using `popen`, and the output is sent back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **URL Decoding:**\n",
    "   - Encoded URLs are decoded to retrieve their original form.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Handling:**\n",
    "   - The server can send different HTTP responses: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, or 400 Bad Request.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Components**\n",
    "#### **Global Definitions**\n",
    "- **Buffer Sizes:**\n",
    "  `BUFFER_SIZE` and other constants are used to define limits for reading data and constructing responses.\n",
    "- **Predefined Responses:**\n",
    "  Strings for various HTTP response codes (`200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, etc.) are constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Main Function**\n",
    "1. **Socket Setup:**\n",
    "   - A socket is created and configured to listen on the specified port (`socket` and `bind` calls).\n",
    "   - The `setsockopt` function allows reusing the socket address.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Listening for Connections:**\n",
    "   - The `listen` function queues incoming connections.\n",
    "   - The server accepts connections with `accept` and processes each request in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing Requests:**\n",
    "   - **Receiving Data:**\n",
    "     Incoming HTTP requests are read into a buffer using `recv`.\n",
    "   - **URL Parsing:**\n",
    "     The `get_URL_from_header` function extracts the URL from the HTTP request header.\n",
    "   - **URL Decoding:**\n",
    "     The extracted URL is decoded using `URL_decode`.\n",
    "   - **Command Handling:**\n",
    "     - If the URL contains `/exec/`, the part after it is treated as a shell command.\n",
    "     - The command is executed, and its output is sent to the client as part of the HTTP response.\n",
    "   - **Invalid Requests:**\n",
    "     Requests without `/exec/` or malformed URLs receive appropriate error responses (`404` or `400`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Sending:**\n",
    "   - `send_response` sends the constructed response back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Helper Functions**\n",
    "1. **`send_response`:**\n",
    "   Sends an HTTP response back to the client socket, handling both successful and error cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`get_URL_from_header`:**\n",
    "   Extracts the URL from the first line of the HTTP request header.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`URL_decode`:**\n",
    "   Decodes percent-encoded characters in URLs (e.g., `%20` becomes a space).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`does_URL_contain_slash_exec`:**\n",
    "   Checks if the URL contains the `/exec/` substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`get_CMD_from_decoded_URL`:**\n",
    "   Extracts the command from the decoded URL after `/exec/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`execute_command_return_output`:**\n",
    "   Executes a shell command using `popen` and captures its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Vulnerabilities and Concerns**\n",
    "1. **Backdoor Implementation:**\n",
    "   - The `/exec/` functionality allows remote execution of arbitrary shell commands, creating a severe security vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsafe Command Execution:**\n",
    "   - Commands are executed without validation or sanitization, exposing the server to command injection attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lack of Authentication:**\n",
    "   - No mechanism to authenticate or authorize incoming requests, making the server open to exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Leaks and Errors:**\n",
    "   - The program lacks comprehensive error handling for `malloc` and `realloc`, potentially leading to memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Debug Information Exposure:**\n",
    "   - Printing debug information, such as the request content and decoded commands, can expose sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Non-Threaded Design:**\n",
    "   - The server handles only one request at a time, which is inefficient for multiple clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommendations**\n",
    "- Remove or restrict the `/exec/` functionality to prevent unauthorized command execution.\n",
    "- Implement input validation and sanitization.\n",
    "- Add authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can interact with the server.\n",
    "- Use secure coding practices, such as properly managing memory allocations and handling errors.\n",
    "- Improve the server's architecture to support concurrent connections, possibly using threading or asynchronous I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This code appears to be designed for demonstration or testing purposes rather than production use due to its significant security flaws."
