# MK Dynamics

Welcome to my website! This site is a collection of my projects and interests in the fields of engineering, computer programming, and electronics. I have a passion for learning and sharing knowledge with others. I hope you find the information here useful and informative.

Additionally, I am a licensed HAM radio operator and enjoy experimenting with antennas and radio equipment. I am also interested in cybersecurity and have completed several certifications in this field.

As of 12/20/2025, I have converted the website to Jupyter Book Version 2 from Version 1.  Some pages still need updates to the new format, but I think the new capabilities of the new version will make the website more interactive and enjoyable.
