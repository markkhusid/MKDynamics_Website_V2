# Object Oriented Programming Using C++

## Introduction 
In this section we will be following along with the examples from ["Object-Oriented Programming Using C++" by Ira Pohl](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-Using-C-2nd/dp/0201895501/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3F67JR9WX9E2K&keywords=object+oriented+programming+using+c%2B%2B&qid=1667165033&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=object+oriented+programming+using+c%2B%2Caps%2C420&sr=8-4) by Ira Pohl (Addison Wesley). We will use Jupyter Lab to facilitate creation of this Jupyter Book.
