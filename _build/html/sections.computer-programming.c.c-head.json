C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"LhMtk3QoH6"}],"key":"trpTUKxvY9"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tables of Contents","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"key":"V6RD2uHSOg"}],"identifier":"tables-of-contents","label":"Tables of Contents","html_id":"tables-of-contents","implicit":true,"key":"cYvAdySprj"},{"type":"grid","columns":[2,2,2,2],"children":[{"type":"card","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/backdoored-webserver/backdoored-webserver","children":[{"type":"header","children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":16,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Backdoored Web Server in C","key":"bUg1FlPvCk"}],"key":"V1mxyQhkuN"}],"key":"cxJGicDhPn"},{"type":"image","url":"/build/backdoored_webserver-f4a4bf47ae4690ce30b796fb818c7e0e.png","height":"200","align":"center","key":"QI38MQPsQs","urlSource":"images/backdoored_webserver.png"}],"urlSource":"Backdoored_Webserver/backdoored_webserver.ipynb","dataUrl":"/sections.computer-programming.c.backdoored-webserver.backdoored-webserver.json","internal":true,"protocol":"file","key":"yLQbAfLiJD"},{"type":"card","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming/beej-s-guide-to-c-programming-head","children":[{"type":"header","children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":1},"end":{"line":26,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Beej’s Guide to C Programming","key":"ZIuSMUYxMl"}],"key":"ImdtF7dLTI"}],"key":"t8bMV7bFXQ"},{"type":"image","url":"/build/beej_s_guide_to_C_pr-87988ac6936eb80e430867e3ae400e5a.png","height":"200","align":"center","key":"C3uN4mEVgM","urlSource":"images/beej_s_guide_to_C_programming.png"}],"urlSource":"Beej_s_Guide_to_C_Programming/Beej_s_Guide_to_C_Programming__HEAD__","dataUrl":"/sections.computer-programming.c.beej-s-guide-to-c-programming.beej-s-guide-to-c-programming-head.json","internal":true,"protocol":"file","key":"jeXg66Obiw"}],"key":"FILcCVG5h7"}],"key":"yEHXxe42BP"}],"key":"YDdmOlATZ5"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"prev":{"title":"Assembly Language Programming","url":"/sections/computer-programming/assembly/assembly","group":"Computer Programming"},"next":{"title":"Backdoored Webserver","url":"/sections/computer-programming/c/backdoored-webserver/backdoored-webserver","group":"Computer Programming"}}},"domain":"http://localhost:3013"}
