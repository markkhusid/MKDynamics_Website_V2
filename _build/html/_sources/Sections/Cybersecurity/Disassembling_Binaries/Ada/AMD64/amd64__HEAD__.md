## Introduction
Ada is a high-level programming language that was originally designed for the U.S. Department of Defense. It is known for its strong typing, modularity, and support for concurrent programming. Ada is often used in safety-critical systems, such as aerospace and defense applications, due to its reliability and maintainability.
