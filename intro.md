# MK Dynamics

Welcome to my website! This site is a collection of my projects and interests in the fields of engineering, computer programming, and electronics. I have a passion for learning and sharing knowledge with others. I hope you find the information here useful and informative.

Additionally, I am a licensed HAM radio operator and enjoy experimenting with antennas and radio equipment. I am also interested in cybersecurity and have completed several certifications in this field.
