    "This is the main driver program that performs the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sanity Check**:\n",
    "   - Iterates over a range of integers from `-16` to `16`.\n",
    "   - For each integer, it calculates the number of set bits using four different methods:\n",
    "     - `naive_count_bits`\n",
    "     - `early_stopping_count_bits`\n",
    "     - `lookup_table_count_bits`\n",
    "     - `kernighan_count_bits`\n",
    "   - Prints the results of these methods alongside the binary representation of the number using the `bit_repr` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Benchmarking**:\n",
    "   - Reads the number of values (`nr_vals`) from the command line using the subroutine `get_arguments`.\n",
    "   - Allocates an array `vals` to store random integers for testing.\n",
    "   - Fills `vals` with random integers.\n",
    "   - Times each of the four bit-counting implementations (`naive`, `early stopping`, `lookup table`, and `Kernighan`) over the generated dataset.\n",
    "   - Prints the timing results for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subroutine `get_arguments`**:\n",
    "   - Validates and extracts the number of integers (`nr_vals`) to process from the command-line arguments.\n",
    "   - Provides error handling if the input is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module `bitmanip_mod`**\n",
    "This module contains the bit-counting algorithms, bit representation logic, and utilities for working with a lookup table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lookup Table Management**:\n",
    "   - A 256-element lookup table (`lookup_table`) is used to optimize bit-counting for bytes (8-bit chunks).\n",
    "   - The `ensure_lookup_table_initialized` subroutine ensures the table is loaded from a CSV file before use.\n",
    "   - `initialize_lookup_table` reads values from `lookup_table.dat` using a CSV reader (`csv_module`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Utility Functions**:\n",
    "   - `bit_repr`: Converts an integer into its binary string representation.\n",
    "   - `remove_trailing_comma_ampersand`: Cleans up lines from the CSV file by removing trailing `, &` for compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bit-Counting Methods**:\n",
    "   - **`naive_count_bits`**:\n",
    "     - Counts bits by iteratively checking the least significant bit using `and(n, 1)` and shifting the number (`ishft`).\n",
    "     - Iterates a fixed number of times (32 for 32-bit integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`early_stopping_count_bits`**:\n",
    "     - Similar to `naive_count_bits`, but exits early when all remaining bits are 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`lookup_table_count_bits`**:\n",
    "     - Divides the integer into four 8-bit chunks.\n",
    "     - Uses the lookup table to sum the number of set bits in each chunk.\n",
    "     - This is faster because it avoids iterative bit operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`kernighan_count_bits`**:\n",
    "     - Uses Brian Kernighan's algorithm, which repeatedly clears the least significant set bit (`n = and(n, n - 1)`) until the number becomes 0.\n",
    "     - The number of iterations equals the number of set bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CSV File Parsing**:\n",
    "   - `parse_csv_file`: Reads a CSV file, preprocesses it to remove trailing artifacts, and populates the lookup table.\n",
    "   - Uses the `csv_module` library for handling CSV data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sanity Check**:\n",
    "   - Validates that all methods produce the same results for small integers (-16 to 16).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Benchmarking**:\n",
    "   - Tests the efficiency of each method over a large dataset of random integers, highlighting performance differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bit Manipulation Techniques**:\n",
    "   - Each method showcases different trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and implementation complexity:\n",
    "     - Naive: Simple but slow.\n",
    "     - Early Stopping: Optimized for sparse integers with fewer set bits.\n",
    "     - Lookup Table: Fast for large datasets, relies on preprocessing and memory.\n",
    "     - Kernighan: Efficient in terms of operations for sparse integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results**:\n",
    "   - Binary representations and bit counts are printed for verification.\n",
    "   - Execution times are reported for performance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features and Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: The `bitmanip_mod` encapsulates reusable logic, making the implementation extendable and maintainable.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive checks for memory allocation, file reading, and input validity.\n",
    "- **Performance Comparison**: Benchmarks allow empirical evaluation of different approaches, useful for understanding their practical efficiency.\n",
    "- **Lookup Table Preprocessing**: Demonstrates efficient preprocessing for rapid bit-counting.\n",

    "## 7. **High-Level Flow Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - The program starts and immediately imports the bit manipulation module (`bitmanip_mod`).\n",
    "   - No explicit module initialization is called here; however, if the user calls a bit-counting method that requires the lookup table, `bitmanip_mod` takes care of loading it on first use.\n",
    "2. **Sanity Check**:\n",
    "   - The program iterates from -16 to 16, computing bit counts via each of the four methods.\n",
    "   - Prints the integer, its binary form, and the counts. This confirms correctness and demonstrates consistency among methods for small positive/negative integers.\n",
    "3. **Command-Line Argument**:\n",
    "   - Reads `nr_vals`, ensuring the user provided one argument (the number of random values to test).\n",
    "4. **Allocate & Populate Data**:\n",
    "   - Dynamically allocates an array of 32-bit integers.\n",
    "   - Fills it with random values spanning the possible integer range.\n",
    "5. **Benchmarking**:\n",
    "   - For each of the four methods:\n",
    "     1. Record start time via `cpu_time`.\n",
    "     2. Loop over `vals`, compute bit count, XOR with `result`.\n",
    "     3. Record end time.\n",
    "     4. Print elapsed time.\n",
    "6. **Exit**:\n",
    "   - After printing all four benchmarks, the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. **Notable Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Negative vs. Positive Values**:\n",
    "   - The sanity check covers negative values. The bit-counting routines will handle them correctly assuming two’s complement. The `bit_repr` function in `bitmanip_mod` displays the internal binary representation, including sign bits for negative numbers.\n",
    "2. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - The four approaches (Naive, Early Stopping, Lookup Table, Kernighan) have different performance characteristics. The program’s timing output shows which approach is fastest for a given number of iterations.\n",
    "3. **`result` XOR**:\n",
    "   - The `result = xor(result, ...)` line ensures that the function call is not optimized away. If the loop simply called `naive_count_bits(vals(i))` without using the result, a compiler might skip or inline it, artificially boosting performance.  \n",
    "   - The XOR ensures a dependency on the returned value, making the measurement more realistic.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - The user can pass large `nr_vals` to create a substantial workload, thus measuring and comparing the methods over many iterations.\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - The program uses `stop` statements with nonzero codes for various error conditions:\n",
    "     - `1`: Wrong number of command-line arguments.\n",
    "     - `2`: Failed to parse integer from the command line.\n",
    "     - `3`: Failure in memory allocation.  \n",
    "   - Messages are written to `error_unit` to help diagnose problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`bitcount.f90`** is a concise yet powerful driver program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrates correctness for multiple bit-counting algorithms (`naive`, `early stopping`, `lookup table`, `Kernighan`).\n",
    "- Benchmarks each method across a user-specified number of randomly generated 32-bit integers.\n",
    "- Leverages the companion module `bitmanip_mod` for all bitwise utilities and the lookup-table feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design makes it easy to compare performance, study different approaches to counting bits, and serve as a template for further exploration of bitwise operations in Fortran."

    "## 9. **Key Observations and Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization and Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - The approach of calling `ensure_lookup_table_initialized()` inside each function ensures that external callers do not need to worry about whether the table is ready.  \n",
    "   - By marking the table and initialization logic private, the module retains control over how the data is loaded and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Trade-Offs**:\n",
    "   - **Naive** and **Early Stopping** methods rely on shifting all or some bits in a loop, straightforward but generally slower.  \n",
    "   - **Kernighan** method iterates only as many times as there are set bits.  \n",
    "   - **Lookup Table** method is typically the fastest for large volumes of data, because it reduces the problem to four table lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - The module checks for I/O issues (`ios` codes) when reading files.  \n",
    "   - If CSV reading fails, it uses `stop` statements to terminate the program with a nonzero exit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CSV Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Because the CSV lines might contain trailing `, &`, the subroutine `remove_trailing_comma_ampersand` cleans each line. This is a helpful technique to ensure the data is in a standard CSV format when eventually read by `csv_module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Memory Usage**:\n",
    "   - The lookup table is only 256 integers in size, which is negligible in modern contexts. However, the code’s design is scalable and well-structured if someone wanted to extend the concept to 16-bit or 64-bit segmented lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "`bitmanip_mod.f90` is a well-structured module providing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Bit-Counting Implementations**:\n",
    "  1. **Naive** (simple, guaranteed 32 iterations).  \n",
    "  2. **Early Stopping** (slightly optimized naive approach).  \n",
    "  3. **Lookup Table** (fast, relies on precomputed 8-bit partial counts).  \n",
    "  4. **Kernighan’s** (iterates by the number of set bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A Portable CSV-Loading Mechanism** that leverages a third-party CSV library and local string-manipulation utilities to populate the lookup table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utility Function** (`bit_repr`) for integer-to-binary-string conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust Initialization**: The separation of concerns between `ensure_lookup_table_initialized` and `initialize_lookup_table` is clean, ensuring the lookup table is always valid when the public routines are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this module exemplifies good Fortran design practices: careful scoping, explicit initialization, and a range of performance-tuned subroutines for a specific bitwise manipulation problem."

    "   - Uses `n = n & (n - 1)`, clearing one set bit per iteration.  \n",
    "   - Performance depends on the number of set bits, not all 32.  \n",
    "   - Often quite efficient, though typically not quite as fast as table lookups for a large batch of random data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the performance ordering in this particular test shows **Lookup Table** as the fastest, followed by **Kernighan**, **Early Stopping**, and then **Naive**.\n",

    "## 3. **Overall Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correctness Check**: The first part (the “sanity check”) assures that for any integer in $[-16,16]$, all four methods return the **same** bit-count. This validates the **integrity** of each algorithm.  \n",
    "- **Performance Comparison**: The second part (timing) highlights the **efficiency trade-offs** between the methods. It illustrates how a **lookup table** can drastically reduce execution time when counting bits repeatedly, while **Kernighan** can also be quite efficient depending on the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the output **both** **confirms** that each bit-counting approach works correctly **and** demonstrates the **relative performance** of each algorithm over 1024 iterations."
