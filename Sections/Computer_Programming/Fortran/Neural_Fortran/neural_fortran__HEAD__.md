# Neural Fortran

## Introduction

We will be experimenting with using Fortran to create Neural Networks.  The framework is provided here:

https://github.com/modern-fortran/neural-fortran 

Of particular interest is the capability to use data - based parallelism to speed up the training of the neural network, as well as a bridge to Keras.
