## Introduction

The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) is a high-performance computing center that provides computational resources and services to the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. NERSC supports a wide range of scientific research by offering advanced computing capabilities, data storage, and software tools.

In this section, we will explore how to utilize NERSC's resources for Fortran programming which incudes parallel computing using OpenMP.
